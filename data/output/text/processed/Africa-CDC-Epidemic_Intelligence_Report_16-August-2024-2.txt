Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:

The ministries of health in the affected MS continue to intensify surveillance, risk communication, and community engagement activities in the
affected areas.

The Permanent Representatives Committee (PRC) of the AU approved $10.4 million for Africa Centres for Disease Control (Africa CDC) to
support the ongoing efforts to combat the mpox outbreak across the continent. On 13 August 2024, due to emergence and rapid spread of
mpox and based on the consensus reached from the Emergency Consultative Group and other consultative bodies, as prescibed by Article 3 of
the Africa CDC Statute, the Director General (DG) of Africa CDC declared mpox epidemic as a public health emergency of continental security.
On 14 August 2024, the DG of WHO declared the mpox epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) in response to
spread of clade |b and its rapid detection in neighbouring countries. These declarations aim to enhance the global response, mitigate the impact
of the health threat, and protect public health while minimizing disruption to travel and trade.

Africa CDC conducted a tri-national meeting with Burundi, DRC and Zambia on cross-border collaboration and information sharing. In addition,
Africa CDC activated the emergency operations centre and appointed continental incident manager to coordinate the response. In addition,
Africa CDC has deployed a high-level team of experts to DRC and South Africa to support the national incident management teams to
coordinate the ongoing response efforts.

Last week, Africa CDC conducted a training of 52 healthcare professionals in Tshop province, DRC on mpox surveillance, Infection; Prevention
and Control, medical management and risk communication and community engagement.
