Assessment

Description:

On 5 June 2023, the National Institute of Communicable Disease (NICD), reported 272 cases and no death of influenza-like illnesses
(ILI) from the pneumonia surveillance programme in six provinces: Eastern Cape, Gauteng, Kwazulu Natal, Mpumalanga, North West
and Western Cape. where sentinel surveillance is being conducted. This observation was made following an increase in ILI that
surpassed the seasonal threshold. The most detected subtype and lineage were influenza A (H3N2) (146 cases), influenza A
(H1N1)pdm09 (116), influenza B Victoria (3) and others (7).

Influenza, also known as flu is an infection of the nose, throat and lungs, which are part of the respiratory system. Influenza A (H3N2),
A (H1N1) pdm09, and influenza B are common seasonal influenza strains in humans. The clinical course of infection and
management of this strain is similar to other influenza strains. The common symptoms include fever, aching muscles, chills and
sweats, headache, dry, persistent cough, shortness of breath, tiredness and weakness, runny or stuffy nose or sore throat. The
majority of people with influenza present with mild illness, but it can also cause severe illness and death especially in high risk groups
such as pregnant women, immunocompromised patients, the elderly and children less than two years old. Influenza is endemic in
South Africa, and commonly occurs between March to April every year.

Response:

The NICD advised the population to take the influenza vaccination before and during the influenza season (March to April)
especially the high risk groups. Additionally, the NICD has advised clinicians to include influenza as a possible diagnosis when
managing patients with respiratory illness.
