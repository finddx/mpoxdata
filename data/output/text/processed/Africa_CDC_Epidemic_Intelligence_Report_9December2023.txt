Description:
On 6 December 2023, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of the Republic of Mali reported 12 confirmed cases and no deaths of Zika virus from
Bamako region. Between 1 - 4 December 2023, samples were collected from patients at the Point G hospital and tested using Trioplex real
time polymerase chain reaction at the molecular biology and genomics laboratory of the University Centre for Clinical Research in Bamako.
Of the samples tested, 12 were positive for Zika virus, while two were positive for both dengue and Zika viruses. Between 2013 and 2016,
a seroprevalence survey for Zika virus which was conducted among 793 asymptomatic volunteers aged 15 years and above in Mali
showed an overall prevalence of 12%.
Zika virus is a mosquito borne virus transmitted by aedes mosquito through bite during the daytime. Since the 1960s, sporadic infections
among humans were being recorded in Africa and Asian countries. However, in 2007, multiple outbreaks were reported in various countries
globally. Zika virus has also been found to be associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome. Persons infected with Zika rarely show symptoms.
However, mild symptoms might show 3 - 14 days after infection and can last for between 2 — 7 days. During pregnancy, Zika virus infection
can cause microcephaly and other congenital malformations in the infant. There is no specific treatment for Zika, and no vaccine has been
approved for the prevention or treatment of Zika virus infection. Elimination of mosquito breeding sites and use of protective clothing
remains the best prevention methods.
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
The MoH continues to create awareness and sensitization among the population in the country, and is implementing preventive and control
measures, including the destruction of habitats for mosquitoes.

Description:
On 4 December 2023, the Government of Tanzania reported the occurrence of landslides caused by heavy rainfall in Hanang district,
western Manyara region, northern Tanzania. As of 4 December, 72 deaths, 117 injuries and two missing persons have been reported. A
total of 5,600 people have been affected and over 750 acres of farmland destroyed by the landslides. In addition, the landslides led to the
destruction of roads, health facilities, water sources and communication systems. The affected population is now more vulnerable to
cholera and other water borne diseases.
Landslides are a type of mass wasting, which denotes any down-slope movement of soil and rocks under the direct influence of gravity and
are often associated with a high number of mortalities, injuries and destruction of property and basic infrastructure. Landslides are often
reported in Tanzania, often triggered by heavy rainfall and accompanied by flooding.
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
The Government of Tanzania and partners deployed a response team to conduct search, rescue and evacuation of persons. In addition, removal of debris is ongoing in
the affected villages.
