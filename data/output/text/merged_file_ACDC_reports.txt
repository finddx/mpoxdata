Description:

On 10 December 2023, the Ministry of Health (MoH) reported two confirmed cases and no deaths of Zika virus from Fatick and Sédhiou
regions. On 13 November 2023, the index case who was a female of unspecified age presented with fever, headache, and eye pain, at
Sokone district hospital, Fatick region. The second case was an 18-year-old male who presented with similar symptoms at Sedhiou
hospital in Sédhiou region. The cases were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction at the Institut Pasteur, Dakar.
A serosurvey conducted between 2011 and 2012 among 2 to 29-year-old-subjects in three Member States (MS) sharing borders: Gambia,
Mali and Senegal; confirmed the presence of Zika virus circulating in these MS with the highest prevalence reported among those between
11-17 years old in Senegal (22.7%). On 6 December 2023, Mali reported 12 confirmed cases and no deaths of Zika virus.
Zika virus is a mosquito borne virus transmitted by aedes mosquito through bite during the daytime. Since the 1960s, sporadic infections
among humans were being recorded in Africa and Asian countries. However, in 2007, multiple outbreaks were reported in various countries
globally. Zika virus has also been found to be associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome. Persons infected with Zika rarely show symptoms.
However, mild symptoms might show 3 - 14 days after infection and can last for between 2 — 7 days. During pregnancy, Zika virus infection
can cause microcephaly and other congenital malformations in the infant. There is no specific treatment for Zika, and no vaccine has been
approved for the prevention or treatment of Zika virus infection. Elimination of mosquito breeding sites and use of protective clothing
remains the best prevention methods.

Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
The MoH is conducting active surveillance at 23 community sentinel surveillance sites for arboviruses located in the 14 regions of the
country. Additionally, Zika virus has been integrated with the routine measles surveillance.

Description:
On 27 December 2023, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) reported 22 deaths as a result of landslide due to heavy rainfall in Kasai-
Central province. In addition, multiple homes have been destroyed. The affected homes were built at the foot of a mountain making them
vulnerable to heavy rains and floods. The last landslide event occurred in DRC in September 2023, where 17 deaths and multiple injuries
were reported from Mongala province.
Landslides are a type of mass wasting, which denotes any down-slope movement of soil and rocks under the direct influence of gravity and
are often associated with a high number of mortalities, injuries and destruction of property and basic infrastructure. Landslides are often
reported in DRC, often triggered by heavy rainfall and accompanied by flooding.
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
The Government of DRC has deployed a multi-sectoral team to conduct a risk assessment to establish the extent of the damage and
intensify search and rescue operations

fatality rate (CFR: 0.27%)] have been reported in five refugee camps and two refugee hosting sites, in Adré (1,331 cases; 4 deaths) and Hadjer-
Hadid (115; 0) health districts. Twenty-five cases and two deaths were reported among pregnant women. In addition, 55% percent of the cases
were males and children <4 years accounted for 31% of the total confirmed cases.
Hepatitis E is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV) and typically presents as acute jaundice. In most people, HEV infection
results in a self-limited, acute illness. However, acute infection can become chronic in rare cases, primarily in people who have received solid-
organ transplants. HEV is typically transmitted by the fecal-oral route. Prevention includes good sanitation and the availability of clean drinking
water. People living in crowded camps or temporary housing, including refugees and internally displaced persons, are at particularly high risk.
HEV is endemic in Chad, particularly in the Tangile region, which last experienced an outbreak in 2022.
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
The MoH organized coordination meetings at the district level and activated the incident management system. In addition, water, sanitation and
hygiene, active case finding, and risk communication and community engagement activities are ongoing in the affected health districts.

Description:
On 13 March 2024, the Ministry of Health (MoH) reported four confirmed cases and no deaths of circulating vaccine derived polio virus type
2 (CVDPV2) from Sokoto sate.
Poliomyelitis (polio) is a highly infectious viral disease that largely affects children under 5 years of age. The virus is transmitted by person-
to-person through the faecal-oral route or by a common vehicle (e.g. contaminated water or food) and multiplies in the intestine, from where
it can invade the nervous system and cause paralysis. Its Incubation period is within 7-14 days and case/fatality rate; 2% to 10%.
Symptoms include Sore throat, headache, vomiting and myalgia followed by flaccid paralysis. Paralysis is typically asymmetrical, and most
often involves the lower extremities. Over 90% to 95% of poliomyelitis infections are asymptomatic and 4% to 8% experience minor
symptoms while 1% to 2% develop paralysis. Poliomyelitis is diagnosed by viral culture (pharynx, stool), serology and nucleic acid
amplification techniques. In 2023, 87 confirmed cases of cVDPV2 were reported from multiple locations in Nigeria.
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
The MoH conducted a supplemental oral polio vaccination campaign from 2 to 5 March 2024 across 18 of the 36 states and federal capital
territory. The campaign targeted children < 5 years of age.

Description:
On 24 July 2024, the Ethiopia Public Health Institute (EPHI) reported the occurrence of three successive landslides in the mountainous areas of
Gezei Gofa woreda, Gofa Zone, South Ethiopia region. The landslide was triggered by heavy rainfall that occurred on the night of 21 July 2024.
As of 24 July 2024, a total of 229 deaths, an unidentified number of displaced persons and 14,000 affected persons have been reported. The
reported deaths include an unidentified number of health extension workers, who were providing emergency support. The South Ethiopia
region has continued to experience heavy rainfall and heavy flooding in the past few months. The region has also reported outbreaks of
malaria, with 288,124 cases reported and measles, with 3,246 cases; six deaths reported since the beginning of this year. The occurrence of
heavy rains and the landslides pose a risk for occurrence of cholera and dengue, which have been reported in the neighbouring regions.
Landslides are a type of mass wasting, which denotes any down-slope movement of soil and rocks under the direct influence of gravity and are
often associated with a high number of mortalities, injuries and destruction of property and basic infrastructure. Landslides are often reported in
Ethiopia, often triggered by heavy rainfall and accompanied by flooding.
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
The Federal Government of Ethiopia in collaboration with partners is coordinating the response interventions. Africa CDC has deployed a team
of experts to support the response efforts.

Assessment
Description:
On 7 June 2024, the Western Cape Veterinary Provincial Department reported an outbreak of rabies among fur seals from Big Bay, Blouberg,
Cape Town. The report was made after confirmation of one Cape fur seal that died on 22 May 2024.
Rabies is a vaccine-preventable, Zoonotic, viral disease that infects the central nervous system. Rabies virus is transmitted through direct
contact with saliva or brain/nervous system tissue of an infected person or animal. Rabies is vaccine preventable; however, is 100% fatal in
humans once clinical symptoms appear. In up to 99% of cases, domestic dogs are responsible for rabies virus transmission to humans. Rabies
can affect both domestic and wild animals. Animal rabies is endemic throughout Africa. This year, South Africa has reported 3 confirmed cases
and three deaths of human rabies from two provinces: Eastern Cape (Eastern Cape (1; 1), KwaZulu Natal (1; 1) and Gauteng (1; 1).
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
The Western Cape Veterinary Services, the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and Environment, City of Cape Town Coastal Management and
other partners are working closely to establish the extent and timeline of the outbreak via further sampling and testing.
Africa CDC has engaged the National Institue for Communicable Diseases for areas of support.

Animal Risk
Assessment
Description:
Since the beginning of this year, a total of 709 human cases (3 confirmed; 706 suspected), four suspected and no confirmed
deaths of anthrax have been reported in three African Union Member States (AU MS): Uganda (5 human cases; 0 deaths),
Zambia (335; 4*) and Zimbabwe (369; 0). In addition, two AU MS (Ghana and Nigeria) have reported anthrax outbreaks in
animals. This week, 397 new human cases and four deaths among suspected cases of anthrax were reported from
Zambia and Zimbabwe.
Zambia: On 1 November 2023, Zambia Ministry of Health (MoH) reported 335 suspected cases with four deaths (1.2%) of
anthrax from six provinces: Eastern (30 suspected cases; 1 death), Lusaka (13; 0), Muchinga (3; 1), Northern (1; 0), Southern
(269; 2) and Western (19; 0). Cases presented with cutaneous eschars and had history of consumption of dead animals
suspected to have died of anthrax. The last outbreak of anthrax in Zambia occurred in 2011 with 511 cases and five deaths
(CFR: 1.0%) in humans and 85 cases among hippopotamuses reported from Chama district.
Zimbabwe: On 15 October 2023, Zimbabwe MoH reported 62 new suspected cases and no deaths of anthrax from Gokwe
South and North districts, Midlands province. Cases presented with eschars on the forearm after consumption of carcasses of
infected animals. Cumulatively since the beginning of 2023, 369 suspected cases and no deaths of anthrax have been reported
from one of 10 provinces in Zimbabwe. The last outbreak of anthrax in Zimbabwe was in 2021.
Anthrax is a zoonotic bacterial infection and can spread to humans through inhalation, handling and eating foods contaminated
with bacterial spores. Clinical presentations may vary from cutaneous, inhalation, gastrointestinal and injection types of anthrax.
The average CFR ranges from 20%-30% in cutaneous anthrax without antibiotic treatment and 25 - 75% for gastrointestinal
anthrax, 80% or higher in inhalation anthrax.
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
The MoH of the affected MS activated emergency operations centres (EOCs) and deployed rapid response teams to conduct
enhance surveillance, risk communication, environmental sanitation, safe burial of dead animals, risk communication and animal
vaccination

Assessment
Description:
On 26 October 2023, the Tunisia Ministry of Health (MoH) reported 10 new confirmed cases and one new death of West Nile
virus (WNV) (CFR: 10%) from five governorates: Gabes (2 confirmed cases; 0 deaths), Kef (1; 0), Monastir (1; 0), Sfax (1; 0) and
Tozeur (5; 1). Samples were tested using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction technique at Institut Pasteur, Tunis.
Cumulatively, since the beginning of 2023, 141 cases (10 confirmed; 131 suspected) and one death (CFR: 10%) of WNV have
been reported from five of 24 governorates in Tunisia.
WNV is a mosquito-borne zoonosis belonging to the genus Flavivirus in the Flaviviridae family. It is transmitted through bite of
infected mosquitoes. Birds are the primary hosts of WNV, thus the virus is maintained in the environment within a "bird—
mosquito—bird" transmission cycle. WNV can affect birds, humans and horses causing asymptomatic infection, mild febrile
illness, meningitis, encephalitis, or death. About 80% of cases in humans present with mild or no symptoms and about 20% of
cases develop fever, headache, vomiting, or a rash while 1% progress to severe forms of the disease with symptoms such as
meningitis with associated neck stiffness, confusion, or seizures. Since 2010, sporadic human meningoencephalitis cases have
been reported in different regions of Tunisia almost every year. The last outbreak of WNV in Tunisia occurred in 2022 with 171
cases and one death (CFR: 0.6%) reported from nine regions.
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
The MoH continues to conduct enhanced surveillance, risk communication and implement vector control measures in the
affected governorates.

Description:
On 6 December 2023, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of the Republic of Mali reported 12 confirmed cases and no deaths of Zika virus from
Bamako region. Between 1 - 4 December 2023, samples were collected from patients at the Point G hospital and tested using Trioplex real
time polymerase chain reaction at the molecular biology and genomics laboratory of the University Centre for Clinical Research in Bamako.
Of the samples tested, 12 were positive for Zika virus, while two were positive for both dengue and Zika viruses. Between 2013 and 2016,
a seroprevalence survey for Zika virus which was conducted among 793 asymptomatic volunteers aged 15 years and above in Mali
showed an overall prevalence of 12%.
Zika virus is a mosquito borne virus transmitted by aedes mosquito through bite during the daytime. Since the 1960s, sporadic infections
among humans were being recorded in Africa and Asian countries. However, in 2007, multiple outbreaks were reported in various countries
globally. Zika virus has also been found to be associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome. Persons infected with Zika rarely show symptoms.
However, mild symptoms might show 3 - 14 days after infection and can last for between 2 — 7 days. During pregnancy, Zika virus infection
can cause microcephaly and other congenital malformations in the infant. There is no specific treatment for Zika, and no vaccine has been
approved for the prevention or treatment of Zika virus infection. Elimination of mosquito breeding sites and use of protective clothing
remains the best prevention methods.
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
The MoH continues to create awareness and sensitization among the population in the country, and is implementing preventive and control
measures, including the destruction of habitats for mosquitoes.

Description:
On 4 December 2023, the Government of Tanzania reported the occurrence of landslides caused by heavy rainfall in Hanang district,
western Manyara region, northern Tanzania. As of 4 December, 72 deaths, 117 injuries and two missing persons have been reported. A
total of 5,600 people have been affected and over 750 acres of farmland destroyed by the landslides. In addition, the landslides led to the
destruction of roads, health facilities, water sources and communication systems. The affected population is now more vulnerable to
cholera and other water borne diseases.
Landslides are a type of mass wasting, which denotes any down-slope movement of soil and rocks under the direct influence of gravity and
are often associated with a high number of mortalities, injuries and destruction of property and basic infrastructure. Landslides are often
reported in Tanzania, often triggered by heavy rainfall and accompanied by flooding.
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
The Government of Tanzania and partners deployed a response team to conduct search, rescue and evacuation of persons. In addition, removal of debris is ongoing in
the affected villages.

affected areas. Specifically, the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency in Nigeria received a donation of 10,000 doses of GYNNEOS
mpox vaccine from the US government. The vaccine is administered in two doses so the target population for mpox vaccination in Nigeria is
5,000 people.
Africa CDC initiated weekly press briefings by the Director General to provide updates on the mpox situation and other health emergencies
across Africa. As part of its political engagement efforts, Africa CDC organized meetings with the President and Prime Minister of the DRC and
the Director General of Africa CDC. The discussions covered the continental strategy to curb the spread of the mpox and specificities related to
the DRC, domestic resource mobilization, and international health solidarity.
At the continental level, Africa CDC has undertaken several additional measures, including the development of a unified continental mpox
preparedness and response strategic plan, hosting weekly consultation meetings with partners and Directors of National Public Health Institutes
in the 13 Member States reporting mpox outbreaks, and mobilizing vaccines for the continent.

Description:

On the 2nd of August 2023, the Algeria Ministry of Health (MoH), reported 80 Diphtheria cases (64 suspected and 16
confirmed) with no deaths in the southern city of Tamanrasset. Most cases were foreigners who were not vaccinated
against Diphtheria from neighboring countries residing in Tamanrasset (at the border areas with the countries of
Sahel).

Diphtheria is a bacterial infection caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, a toxin producing bacteria. Person to
person transmission is usually through respiratory droplets (respiratory form) and contact with infected sores and
ulcers on the skin (cutaneous form). Symptoms for the respiratory form include weakness, sore throat, fever, swollen
lymph nodes, difficulty in breathing, and death in more severe cases. The overall case-fatality rate for the respiratory
form of diphtheria is between 5%-—10%, with higher death rates (up to 20%) among persons younger than 5 or older
than 40 years of age. Laboratory diagnosis is made via bacterial culture, Elek test or polymerase chain reaction
(PCR). Treatment includes antibiotic therapy. Vaccines are available to protect against infection and typically given in
four doses as part of routine immunization programs. The last outbreak of Diphtheria in Algeria occurred in August
2022.

Response by MS/Partners:

The MoH deployed a rapid response team (RRT) to the affected area to conduct case management, risk
communication and vaccination of the affected community. According to media reports, a crisis response unit has
been set up and over 10000 foreigners have been vaccinated against Diphtheria.

Description:
On 3 July 2023, an outbreak of a suspected hemorrhagic fever was reported from Longechuk county, Upper Nile
state, north eastern South Sudan. Suspected cases were first identified on 16 June 2023, during routine supportive
supervision activities conducted by the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Dajo primary health care unit, northern Longechuk
county. The cases presented with bloody diarrhoea, vomiting blood, general body weakness, cough, body rash, loss
of appetite, red eyes and swollen faces. All 14 samples tested at the National Public Health Laboratory, Juba, were
negative for Ebola virus disease, Marburg virus disease, yellow fever, Rift Valley fever, dengue fever and Crimean-
Congo haemorrhagic fever.
As of 5 July 2023, a total of 150 suspected cases and 23 deaths (case fatality rate [CFR]: 15.3%) have been reported
from Upper Nile state. Majority of the deaths (60%) occurred among children and these were reported from Pashimbi
(43%) and Dajo (17%).
Response:
The MoH convened an urgent partner meeting to plan the response and deployed a rapid response team (RRT) to
Upper Nile state to conduct further epidemiological investigations. In addition, the MoH plans to collect additional
samples for further laboratory investigation.
The Africa CDC Epidemic Intelligence team held an emergency meeting with the South Sudan MoH to verify the
reports and explore potential areas of support for the response.

Ethiopian PHI Source GeoScope Risk Assessment
Description:
Since epidemiological (Epi) week 15 (10 - 16 April 2023), the Ethiopian Public Health Institute (EPHI) has reported a
total of 6,238 cases (64 confirmed; 6,174 suspected) and four deaths (CFR: 6.3%) of dengue fever from Afar region
and Dire Dewa city administration. Majority (98%) of the cases are from Afar region.
Dengue is an arbovirus in the Filiviridae family, transmitted primarily by Aedes mosquitoes. Aedes mosquitoes are
responsible for transmitting chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus. There are four distinct, but closely related,
serotypes of the virus (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4). The average CFR of dengue is less than 1%, but
can be up to 15% if untreated. Recovery from infection is believed to confer lifelong immunity against a serotype. The
last outbreak of dengue fever in Ethiopia occurred in 2019 where 1,251 cases and no deaths were reported from Afar
region.
Response:
The EPHI activated the regional emergency operations centers (EOCs) to coordinate the response and continues to
conduct enhanced surveillance and case management at designated treatment centers. In addition, vector control
activities are ongoing in the affected regions.

Assessment
Description:
On 10 September 2023, Libya Ministry of Interior announced that the coastal city of Derna in eastern Libya and surrounding cities
namely Al-Marj, Benghazi and Sousse had been devastated by floods caused by torrential rains due to Storm Daniel. The city of
Derna was declared a disaster zone after two dams burst due to the rainstorm, forcing whole neighborhoods with their
residents into the sea. Storm Daniel was accompanied by flooding that destroyed infrastructure and buildings, leading to the
displacement of over 38,000 people. The destruction of these vital infrastructure, such as health and sanitation facilities, poses a
risk for the spread of communicable diseases in the affected areas. As of 13 September 2023, 6,872 deaths and 10,120 missing
people were reported by the Libyan authorities.
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
Libyan authorities in the east of the country declared a state of emergency, and closed schools and shops in the city. The Derna
city council has enacted a 7 p.m. - 8 a.m. curfew and carried out evacuations in the worst hit neighborhoods in the city. In
addition, the Libyan national army deployed rapid response teams (RRT) to manage the crisis.

Description:
On 16 July 2023, the Ministry of Health (MoH) ,Cote d’lvoire reported an oubtreak of dengue fever with 107 cases (22 confirmed; 85
suspected) and no deaths from the country. Confirmatory diagnosis was made at the Institut Pasteur in Dakar by polymerase chain
reaction (PCR). The cases were reported from four of the 14 districts: Cocody-Bingerville, Soubre, Treichville-Marcory and Yopougon
Ouest, with Cocody-Bingerville accounting for 95% of the total cases reported.
Dengue is an arbovirus in the Fliviridae family, transmitted primarily by Aedes mosquitoes. Aedes mosquitoes are responsible for
transmitting chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus. There are four distinct, but closely related, serotypes of the virus (DENV-1,
DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4). The average CFR of dengue is less than 1%, but can be up to 15% if untreated. Recovery from
infection is believed to confer lifelong immunity against a serotype. The virus is endemic in tropical areas of Africa, the Americas, the
Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia and the Western Pacific
Response:
The MoH is conducting clinical management of cases. In addition, risk communication and vector control activities in the most
affected area of Cocody-Bingerville — Adjame are ongoing.

Health Assessment

Description:
On 23 May 2023, the Ministry of Health (MoH), Namibia reported an outbreak of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) following
laboratory confirmation in a male patient at Windhoek Central Hospital. The confirmation was made by the National Institute for
Communicable Diseases of South Africa. The index case presented with bleeding gums and headache at a clinic in Gobabis,
Omaheke region, eastern Namibia on 16 May 2023. He was later transferred to Windhoek Central Hospital, where he died on 18 May
2023.
CCHF is a zoonotic viral hemorrhagic fever that can spread through bites of infected ticks. It can also be transmitted from animals to
humans through contact with blood, body fluids, or tissues of infected animals, mainly livestock such as cattle, sheep, goats,
buffalo and camels. Although livestock can be infected with the virus, most do not manifest clinical symptoms. There is currently no
approved safe and effective vaccine for human use, and treatment for CCHF is primarily supportive. The last outbreak of CCHF in
Namibia occurred in 2020, with two cases and no deaths from Oshkoto and Omusati regions.

Response:
The MoH has deployed a team to the field to investigate this outbreak. A total of 27 contacts have been identified including 24 health
workers. In addition, emergency management committees have been established in Khomas and Omaheke regions, risk
communication and community engagements are ongoing in affected communities, and the veterinary department has been engaged
to institute control measures in livestock.

Update to Event:
Since the beginning of this year, a total of 12,820 cases (7,592 confirmed; 5,228 suspected) and 535 deaths (CFR: 7.1%) of
diphtheria have been reported in four African Union (AU) Member States (MS): Algeria: (80 cases, 10 deaths), Guinea (288; 52),
Niger (865; 37) and Nigeria (11,587; 436).
This week, 507 new cases and four new deaths of diphtheria were reported from Guinea, Niger and Nigeria.
Guinea: Since the last update (8 September 2023), the MoH reported 114 new suspected cases and no new deaths of diphtheria

(260; 39). Children between 1-4 years account for more than half (51.3%) of the cases. The national routine immunization coverage
for the third dose of pentavalent vaccine (which includes diphtheria vaccine) was 47% in 2022. This low coverage in the region, in a
context of large population movements due to mining, drives the outbreak.
Niger: Since the last update (1 September 2023), the MoH reported 70 new cases (3 confirmed; 67 suspected) and two new deaths
(CFR: 2.9%) of diphtheria. Cumulatively, 865 cases (360 confirmed; 505 suspected) and 37 deaths (CFR: 4.3%) have been reported

total cases were vaccinated against diphtheria.
Nigeria: Since the last update (15 September 2023), the Nigeria Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (NCDC) reported 323
new suspected cases and two new deaths (CFR: 0.6%) of diphtheria. Cumulatively, 11,587 cases (7,202 confirmed; 4,385 suspected)
and 436 deaths (CFR: 3.8%) have been reported from 31 of 36 states of Nigeria. There has been a 41.5% average increase in the
number of new cases reported over the last four weeks. More than 71% of all cases were children between 1-14 years; 21% of whom
were fully vaccinated.

As 28 September 2023, a total of 12,320,058 COVID-19 cases and 257,167 deaths (CFR: 2.1%) have been reported by the 55 African
Union Member States MS (first mention). This represents 2% of all cases and 4% of all deaths reported globally. Fifty-three MS have
reported COVID-19 cases infected with the Alpha (50 MS), Beta (45), Delta (53), Gamma (5) and Omicron (51) variants of concern
(VOC). Additionally, 32 MS have reported the presence of the Omicron BA.2 subvariant, 17 Member States reported the Omicron
sub lineage (XBB.1.5), 12 MS reported the Omicron sub lineage (BF.7 or BA.5.2.1.7), and 2 Member States have reported the

Americas, Asia, Europe and Oceania. As of 28 September 2023, nine Member States (Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Egypt,
Kenya, Mauritius, Morocco, South Africa, Tunisia and Uganda) have reported the presence of this new variant of interest (VOI).
Following an initial risk assessment conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO), the public health risk associated with
EG.5 is currently rated as low on a global level, similar to the risk of XBB.1.16 and other VOls. Fifty-four (98%) MS are currently
providing COVID-19 vaccination to the general population.
Cumulatively, 1.1 billion doses have been administered on the continent. Of these doses administered, 570.5 million people have
been partially vaccinated, and 453.8 million have been fully vaccinated. Eritrea is the only AU MS yet to start COVID-19 vaccination
roll out.
For Epi week 38 (18 - 24 September), 378 new COVID-19 cases were reported. The Northern region accounted for 54% of the new
COVID-19 cases reported this week, followed by the Central region (45%). No cases were reported in the Eastern and Southern
regions. Last week, no new COVID-19 deaths were reported in Africa. More than 4,500 new tests were conducted during the past
week. The weekly % test positivity increased from 7% to 8% compared to the previous week. Since February 2020, over 134 million
COVID-19 tests have been conducted in Africa.

been reported by the 55 African Union Member States (MS). This represents 2% of all cases and 4% of all deaths reported globally.
Fifty-three MS have reported COVID-19 cases infected with the Alpha (50 MS), Beta (45), Delta (53), Gamma (5) and Omicron (51)
variants of concern (VOC). Additionally, 32 MS have reported the presence of the Omicron BA.2 sub-variant, 17 Member States
reported the Omicron sub lineage (XBB.1.5), 12 MS reported the Omicron sub lineage (BF.7 or BA.5.2.1.7), and 2 Member States
have reported the Omicron sub lineage (XBB.1.16). Another sub-variant of Omicron (B.1.1.529) called EG.5 has been detected and
reported in Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe and Oceania. As of 5 October 2023, nine Member States: Cape Verde, Central African
Republic, Egypt, Kenya, Mauritius, Morocco, South Africa, Tunisia and Uganda have reported the presence of this new variant of
interest (VOI). Following an initial risk assessment conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO), the public health risk
associated with EG.5 is currently rated as low on a global level, similar to the risk of XBB.1.16 and other VOls. Fifty-four (98%) MS
are currently providing COVID-19 vaccination to the general population.Cumulatively, 1.1 billion doses have been administered on the
continent. Of these doses administered, 570.6 million people have been partially vaccinated, and 446.9 million have been fully
vaccinated. Eritrea is the only AU MS yet to start COVID-19 vaccination roll out.

ssessment

Description:
On 24 November 2023, the Kenya Ministry of Health (MoH) reported the occurrence of floods caused by heavy rainfall
attributed to the El Nino phenomenon. As of 29 November 2023, the floods have led to 85 deaths and displacement of
315,217 persons in 33 of the 47 counties in Kenya. In addition, a total of 16 missing persons and 205 injuries have been
reported across multiple counties. Health services in 19 counties were disrupted as a result of the flood. Affected counties are
at risk of vector and water borne diseases.
Floods are the most frequent type of natural disaster and occur when an overflow of water submerges land that is usually dry.
Floods are often caused by heavy rainfall and have potential to cause widespread devastation including loss of lives and
damages to personal property and infrastructure.
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
The MoH activated the national and county public health emergency operations centres (PHEOC) and developed the El Nino
contingency plan. In addition, risk communication, enhanced disease surveillance, provision of water, sanitation and hygiene
supplies, mapping and repair of affected infrastructure and prepositioning of cholera kits are some of the ongoing
interventions, led by the government with support from partners.

Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:

The ministries of health in the affected MS continue to intensify surveillance, risk communication, and community engagement activities in the
affected areas.

The Permanent Representatives Committee (PRC) of the AU approved $10.4 million for Africa Centres for Disease Control (Africa CDC) to
support the ongoing efforts to combat the mpox outbreak across the continent. On 13 August 2024, due to emergence and rapid spread of
mpox and based on the consensus reached from the Emergency Consultative Group and other consultative bodies, as prescibed by Article 3 of
the Africa CDC Statute, the Director General (DG) of Africa CDC declared mpox epidemic as a public health emergency of continental security.
On 14 August 2024, the DG of WHO declared the mpox epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) in response to
spread of clade |b and its rapid detection in neighbouring countries. These declarations aim to enhance the global response, mitigate the impact
of the health threat, and protect public health while minimizing disruption to travel and trade.

Africa CDC conducted a tri-national meeting with Burundi, DRC and Zambia on cross-border collaboration and information sharing. In addition,
Africa CDC activated the emergency operations centre and appointed continental incident manager to coordinate the response. In addition,
Africa CDC has deployed a high-level team of experts to DRC and South Africa to support the national incident management teams to
coordinate the ongoing response efforts.

Last week, Africa CDC conducted a training of 52 healthcare professionals in Tshop province, DRC on mpox surveillance, Infection; Prevention
and Control, medical management and risk communication and community engagement.

Description:
On 29 May 2024, the Ministry of Agriculture (MoAg) reported 429 confirmed cases of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 with 100%
mortality among non-poultry birds from the Tanji Bird Reserve. The affected wild birds included: Grey headed gulls (44 cases), Caspian terns (49), and
Royal terns (336). Confirmatory tests conducted at the National Laboratory of Livestock and Veterinary Research in Dakar, Senegal confirmed HPAI
H5N1 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Since its emergence in 1997, HPAI viruses have become enzootic in some countries, infecting wild birds and causing outbreaks in poultry and
sporadic human infections across a wide geographic area. These viruses occur naturally among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic
poultry as well as other birds and animal species. Wild aquatic birds are considered reservoirs (hosts) for avian influenza. Susceptible birds become
infected through contact with the virus shed by infected birds or by coming into contact with surfaces contaminated with the virus from infected birds.
There are two types of pathogenic avian influenza viruses: Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPAI) and HPAI. Both HPAI and LPAI viruses can spread
rapidly through poultry flocks and can cause mild to severe illness in infected humans. Depopulation (culling), quarantine of exposed birds, and
improved surveillance are the preferred outbreak control measures. The best mean of prevention in humans is to avoid sources of exposure to HPAI.
The last reported outbreak of HPAI H5N1 in Gambia was in 2023 with 7,569 cases and 100% mortality reported from 16 bird landing sites located in
all five regions of the Gambia.
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
The MoAg is improving plans for effective response to prevent spill into domestic birds.

Description:
On 3rd June 2024, the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) reported an outbreak of cutaneous anthrax with 10 confirmed cases and two
deaths (CFR: 20%) among butchers from four public abattoirs in Nord Kivu province. This followed investigation by health authorities in DRC after
abattoirs butchers complained of skin lesions around the neck, jaw, and arms. Samples collected from the lesions were confirmed positive for
cutaneous anthrax at the Goma Veterinary Laboratory. Subsequently, samples collected from cattle in the same abattoirs and tested at the Central
Veterinary Laboratory also turned out positive for anthrax. Additionally, 15 animal cases were reported from the Virunga National Park in Nord Kivu.
These cases included a water buffalo (1 case) and Hippopotamus (14) with 100% mortality. These hippopotamus carcasses, which died from anthrax,
were observed lining the banks of river lubimbi, which runs through Virunga National Park. The law prohibits any attempt to treat animals in Virunga
park because it is a natural park with no external interference allowed. Virunga park shares a border with Uganda and Rwanda.
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
The MoH continues to enhance surveillance, risk communication, environmental sanitation, and safe burial of dead animals, as well as to strengthen
animal vaccination against anthrax. Additionally, the population was advised to avoid drinking water from the Lulimbi River and picking up any dead
domestic or wild animals.

Update to Event:
Since the beginning of this year, a total of 32,953 cases (6,950 confirmed; 4,770 probable; 21,233 suspected) and 47 deaths (CFR: 0.14%) of
dengue fever have been reported from nine AU MS: Burkina Faso (20,570 cases; 37 deaths), Cameroon (1; 0), Chad (983; 0), Ethiopia (1,725;
2), Kenya (88; 0), Mali (3,242; 3), Mauritius (6,312; 5), Sao Tome and Principe (9; 0) and Senegal (23; 0). This week, 21,136 new cases and 37
new deaths of dengue fever were reported from Burkina Faso, Mali and Mauritius.
Burkina Faso (initial report): Since the beginning of the year, the MoH reported 20,570 cases (0 confirmed; 4,770 probable; 15,800
suspected) and 37 deaths (CFR: 0.2%) of dengue fever from all 13 regions in Burkina Faso. The two most affected regions were Center (11,277
cases; 14 deaths) and Hauts-Bassins (3,644; 9). The last outbreak of dengue fever in Burkina Faso occurred in 2023 with 242,425 cases and
709 deaths (CFR: 0.3%), reported from all 13 regions.
Mali: Since the last update (12 April 2024), the MoH reported 177 new cases (26 confirmed; 151 suspected) and no new deaths of dengue
fever from two regions: Bamako (176 cases) and Koulikoro (1). This is a 45% decrease in the number of new cases compared to the last
update. Cumulatively, 3,242 cases (558 confirmed; 2,684 suspected) and three deaths (CFR: 0.09%) of dengue fever have been reported from
nine of ten regions in Mali this year. Two serotypes (VDEN-1 and VDEN-3) were detected among confirmed cases. This is a protracted outbreak
that started in September 2023.
Mauritius: Since the last update (12 April 2024), the MoH reported 389 new confirmed cases and no new deaths of dengue fever from two
islands: Mauritius (293 cases) and Rodrigues (96). This is an 8.4% increase in the number of new cases compared to the last update.
Cumulatively, 6,312 confirmed cases and five deaths (CFR: 0.08%) of dengue fever have been reported from Mauritius (4,383 local cases; 10
imported cases; 5 deaths) and Rodrigues (1,915; 4; 0) islands in Mauritius.
Dengue is an arbovirus in the Fliviridae family, transmitted primarily by Aedes mosquitoes. Aedes mosquitoes are also responsible for
transmitting chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus. There are four distinct, but closely related, serotypes of the virus (DENV-1, DENV-2,
DENV-3, and DENV-4). The average CFR of dengue is less than 1% but can be up to 15% if untreated. Recovery from infection is believed to
confer lifelong immunity against a serotype.
Note: In 2023, a total of 280,218 cases (21,999 confirmed; 70,433 probable; 187,786 suspected) and 808 deaths (CFR: 0.3%) of dengue fever
were reported from 18 AU MS: Angola (3 cases; 0 deaths), Benin ( 6; 1), Burkina Faso (242,425; 709); Cabo Verde (410; 0), Chad (1,581; 1),

Nigeria (84; 0), Sao Tome and Principe (1,227; 11), Senegal (254; 0), Sudan (1,664; 7) and Togo (8; 0).
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
The ministries of health of the affected MS continue to conduct enhanced surveillance, case management, vector control and risk
communication activities in the affected areas.

The ministries of health in the affected MS continue to intensify surveillance, risk communication, and community engagement activities in the
affected areas. Specifically in South Africa, the Department of Health confirmed receipt of another donation of Tecovirimat from WHO to further
support the management of cases.

Africa CDC activated the emergency operations centre and appointed continental incident manager to coordinate the response. In addition,
Africa CDC has deployed a high-level team of experts to DRC and South Africa to support the national incident management teams to
coordinate the ongoing response efforts. Following the spread of the disease to other non-endemic countries, Africa CDC has initiated
consultations with Heads of States and partners on the possibility of declaring mpox as a public health emergency of continental security.

Description:
On 28 May 2024, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) of South Africa reported two confirmed cases and two deaths [case
fatality rate (CFR): 100%] of rabies from Eastern Cape (1 case; 1 death) and KwaZulu Natal (1; 1) provinces. Additionally, one fatal case that
was reported in Gauteng province had a history of exposure from a neighbouring country. All cases were children aged two, five, and seven
years. Two of the confirmed cases did not seek medical intervention post-exposure, while one case received an incomplete regimen of rabies
post-exposure prophylaxis.
Rabies virus is a zoonotic, viral disease that infects the central nervous system. It is transmitted through direct contact with saliva or
brain/nervous system tissue of an infected person or animal. Rabies is vaccine-preventable; however, it is 100% fatal in humans once clinical
symptoms appear. In up to 99% of cases, domestic dogs are responsible for rabies virus transmission to humans. Rabies can affect both
domestic and wild animals. Animal rabies is endemic throughout South Africa. In 2023, a total of 12 confirmed cases and 12 deaths (CFR:
100%) of human rabies were reported from three of the nine provinces in South Africa: Eastern Cape (5 cases; 5 deaths), KwaZulu Natal (6; 6)
and Limpopo (1; 1).
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
The provincial veterinary department is enhancing rabies vaccination for dogs and cats.

was confirmed positive for RVF. The case was managed and has been stabilized. No animal case of RVF was reported around the vicinity of
the case.
RVF is a vector-borne, viral Zoonotic disease. It can be transmitted to humans through contact with blood/organs of infected animals or bites
from infected mosquitoes. Infected persons often present with mild symptoms including joint pain, flu-like fever, muscle pain, loss of appetite,
and headache. Severe infections can result in deaths; however, the case fatality rate is generally below 1%. The last case of RVF in Senegal
was reported in June 2023 among wild animals, with three confirmed cases and two deaths (CFR: 67%) in Guembeul natural reserve, Gandiol
region.
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
The MoH coordinated a multisectoral and multidisciplinary team to investigate and respond to the outbreak through active case search and risk communication. Additionally,
nine contacts have been identified and are being monitored.

index case was a 42-year-old casual laborer who presented with eschars. Samples collected and submitted to the Uganda Virus
Research Institute, Arua, tested positive for anthrax. Cumulatively, five cases (3 confirmed; 2 suspected) and no deaths have been
reported. In addition, the occurrence of 10 sudden animal deaths have been reported in Kween district.
Anthrax is a zoonotic bacterial infection and can spread to humans through inhalation, handling, eating and drinking foods
contaminated with bacterial spores. Clinical presentations may vary from cutaneous, inhalation, gastrointestinal and injection types
of anthrax. The average CFR ranges from 20% - 30% in cutaneous anthrax without antibiotic treatment and 25% - 75% for
gastrointestinal anthrax, 80% or higher in inhalation anthrax.
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
The MoH continues to conduct enhanced surveillance and risk communication in the affected district.

Update to Event:
Since January 2023, a total of 15,852 cases (9,876 confirmed; 5,976 suspected) and 656 deaths (CFR: 6.6%) of diphtheria have
been reported in four African Union Member States (MS): Algeria (80 cases; 10 deaths), Guinea (417; 60), Mauritania (8; 4), Niger
(865; 37) and Nigeria (14,482; 545). This week, eight new cases and four new deaths from diphtheria (CFR: 50%) were reported
from Mauritania.
Mauritania: On 24 October 2023, the Ministry of Health (MoH), Mauritania reported an outbreak of diphtheria with eight suspected
cases and 4 deaths (CFR: 50%). The cases were reported from Bassiknou district in Hodh El Chargui province close to the border
with Mali. On 19 October 2023, the index case presented at Bassiknou hospital with fever, sore throat, swollen tonsils and difficulty
in breathing. All eight samples tested negative by bacterial culture at the National Public Health laboratory, Mauritania. However,
this could have been due to suboptimal storage conditions while transporting the samples to the laboratory. The cases are between
1 - 15 years old, and majority (63%) are unvaccinated. Poor vaccination coverage, especially in the affected area, was identified as
a risk factor for this outbreak.
Diphtheria is a bacterial infection caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, a toxin producing bacteria. Diphtheria manifests in two
forms: respiratory (most commonly seen) and cutaneous. Person to person transmission is usually through respiratory droplets
(respiratory form) and contact with infected sores and ulcers on the skin (cutaneous form). Symptoms for the respiratory form
include weakness, sore throat, fever, swollen lymph nodes, difficulty breathing, and death in more severe cases. The toxin produced
by the bacteria destroys healthy respiratory tissues forming a thick gray coating on the throat, tonsils and nose making it difficult to
breathe and swallow. The toxin can also affect the heart, nervous system, and kidneys if infection is systemic. The overall case-
fatality rate for the respiratory form of diphtheria is between 5% and 10%, with higher death rates (up to 20%) among persons
younger than five or older than 40 years of age. Laboratory diagnosis is made via bacterial culture, Elek test or polymerase chain
reaction (PCR). Treatment includes anti-toxins and antibiotic therapy. Vaccines are available to protect against infection and
typically given in four doses as part of routine immunization programs.
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
Mauritania: The MoH activated the EOC and deployed a rapid response team for active case finding case management and mass
sensitization of local communities' leaders involved in health education.

Description:
On 1 January 2024, the National Bureau of Risk and Disaster Management (BNGRC) reported the occurrence of floods
caused by the landfall of tropical storm Alvaro over the southwestern-central coast of Madagascar. A total of 10 deaths and
9,528 displaced persons across five of 22 regions in Madagascar have been reported. In addition, an estimated 25,837
persons have been affected by the floods and 59 classrooms have been completely damaged.
A flash flood is a rapid flooding of low-lying areas. It may be caused by heavy rain associated with a severe thunderstorm,
hurricane, or tropical storm. Flash floods are a significant hazard with potential to cause fatalities and displacement of people.
Flash floods can also deposit large quantities of sediments on floodplains.
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
BNGRC activated the emergency operations centre and continues to issue cyclone warning instructions. In addition, the
BNGRC has deployed a rapid response team to coordinate the response in the affected regions; including evacuation of
displaced persons, mapping of areas impacted by the floods, public health awareness.

Update to Event:
As of 6 p.m. East African Time (EAT) 24 August 2023, a total of 12,314,546 COVID-19 cases and 258,500 deaths (CFR: 2.1%)
have been reported by the 55 AU MS. This represents 2% of all cases and 4% of all deaths reported globally.
Fifty-three MS have reported COVID-19 cases infected with the Alpha (50 MS), Beta (45), Delta (53), Gamma (5) and Omicron
(51) variants of concern (VOC). Additionally, 32 MS have reported the presence of the Omicron BA.2 subvariant, 17 Member
States reported the Omicron sub lineage (XBB.1.5), 12 MS reported the Omicron sub lineage (BF.7 or BA.5.2.1.7), and 2 Member
States have reported the Omicron sub lineage (XBB.1.16). Another subvariant of Omicron (B.1.1.529) called EG.5 has been
detected and reported in Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe and Oceania. As of 24 August 2023, four Member States (Cape Verde,
Egypt, South Africa and Uganda) have reported the presence of this new variant of interest (VOI). Following an initial risk
assessment conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO), the public health risk associated with EG.5 is currently rated as
low on a global level, similar to the risk of XBB.1.16 and other VOls.
Fifty-four (98%) MS are currently providing COVID-19 vaccination to the general population. Cumulatively, 1.1 billion doses have
been administered on the continent. Of these doses administered, 570.5 million people have been partially vaccinated, and 453.8
million have been fully vaccinated. Eritrea is the only AU MS yet to start COVID-19 vaccination roll out.
For Epi week 33 (14 - 20 August 2023), 124 new COVID-19 cases were reported, which is a 13% decrease in the number of new
cases reported compared to the previous week (32). The Northern region accounted for 60% of the new COVID-19 cases
reported this week, followed by the Central (28%), Western (10%), Southern (2%) and no case reported in Eastern region.
Last week, four new COVID-19 deaths were reported in Africa. More than two thousand new tests were conducted during the past
week. The weekly % test positivity decreased from 7% to 6% compared to the previous week. Since February 2020, over 133
million COVID-19 tests have been conducted in Africa.

Assessment

Description:

On 5 June 2023, the National Institute of Communicable Disease (NICD), reported 272 cases and no death of influenza-like illnesses
(ILI) from the pneumonia surveillance programme in six provinces: Eastern Cape, Gauteng, Kwazulu Natal, Mpumalanga, North West
and Western Cape. where sentinel surveillance is being conducted. This observation was made following an increase in ILI that
surpassed the seasonal threshold. The most detected subtype and lineage were influenza A (H3N2) (146 cases), influenza A
(H1N1)pdm09 (116), influenza B Victoria (3) and others (7).

Influenza, also known as flu is an infection of the nose, throat and lungs, which are part of the respiratory system. Influenza A (H3N2),
A (H1N1) pdm09, and influenza B are common seasonal influenza strains in humans. The clinical course of infection and
management of this strain is similar to other influenza strains. The common symptoms include fever, aching muscles, chills and
sweats, headache, dry, persistent cough, shortness of breath, tiredness and weakness, runny or stuffy nose or sore throat. The
majority of people with influenza present with mild illness, but it can also cause severe illness and death especially in high risk groups
such as pregnant women, immunocompromised patients, the elderly and children less than two years old. Influenza is endemic in
South Africa, and commonly occurs between March to April every year.

Response:

The NICD advised the population to take the influenza vaccination before and during the influenza season (March to April)
especially the high risk groups. Additionally, the NICD has advised clinicians to include influenza as a possible diagnosis when
managing patients with respiratory illness.

Assessment

Description:
On 21 April 2023, the Senegal MoH reported an outbreak of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in Fadia city, Guediawaye
district, Dakar region. The index case was a 35-year-old-male butcher from Fadia city. On 10 April 2023, he presented at Dalal Jamm
hospital with flu-like symptoms. On 21 April 2023, blood samples were collected and CCHF was confirmed at Institut Pasteur, Dakar
by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). He died on 22 April 2023 after developing
hemorrhagic symptoms and was given a safe and dignified burial on 24 April 2023. So far, no other confirmed case has been
reported, however, 19 suspected cases have been identified from the contact list and are being investigated.
CCHF is a zoonotic viral hemorrhagic fever that can spread through bites of infected ticks. It can also be transmitted from animals to
humans through contact with blood, body fluids, or tissues of infected animals, mainly livestock such as cattle, sheep, goats,
buffalo and camels. Although livestock can be infected with the virus, most do not manifest clinical symptoms. There is currently no
approved safe and effective vaccine for human use, and treatment for CCHF is primarily supportive. The last outbreak of CCHF in
Senegal was in November 2022 with a single case and no death reported from Dakar.

Response:
The MoH has activated the emergency operation centre and has also deployed a multi-sectoral, multi-disciplinary team to Dakar to
support with response activities. A total of 87 contacts were identified from two districts namely Guediawaye (83 contacts) and Dakar
ciity centre (4). All contacts are being monitored and three of the 87 contacts have completed their monitoring cycle. Additionally, the
veterinary services are monitoring livestock in the affected area.

Assessment

Description:
On 2 May 2023, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) of South Africa reported two confirmed cases and no
deaths of of diphtheria from KwaZulu Natal (1 confirmed case) and Western Cape provinces (1).
Diphtheria is a bacterial infection caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, a toxin-producing bacteria. Diphtheria manifests in two
forms: respiratory (most commonly seen) and cutaneous. Person-to-person transmission is usually through respiratory droplets
(respiratory form) and contact with infected sores and ulcers on the skin (cutaneous form). Symptoms for the respiratory form include
weakness, sore throat, fever, swollen lymph nodes, difficulty breathing, and death in more severe cases. The toxin produced by the
bacteria destroys healthy respiratory tissues forming a thick gray coating on the throat, tonsils and nose making it difficult to breathe
and swallow. The toxin can also affect the heart, nervous system, and kidneys if the infection is systemic. The overall case fatality rate
for the respiratory form of diphtheria is between 5 to 10%, with higher death rates (up to 20%) among persons less than five or older
than 40 years old. Laboratory diagnosis is made via bacterial culture, Elek test or PCR. Treatment includes anti-toxins and antibiotic
therapy. Vaccines are available to protect against infection and typically given in four doses as part of routine immunization programs.
In South Africa, the last outbreak of diphtheria occurred in 2022, in which three confirmed cases with no deaths were reported from
Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces.

Response:
Samples collected from all contacts tested negative for diphtheria. Currently there is no diphtheria anti-toxin available in the
country. The Western Cape provincial department of health is working with the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority to
get more stock into the country.

Description:
On 22 March 2024, the Ministry of Health (MoH) reported one confirmed case and no deaths of Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF)
from Dakar. The case was a 25-year-old male animal breeder from Ndoffanne district. He reported to the national hospital in Dakar with
symptoms of high fever, skin rashes and he was also bleeding. Blood sample collected from the case tested positive for CCHF by
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at the Institut Pasteur de Dakar. The case has been managed and stabilized.
CCHF is a zoonotic viral hemorrhagic fever that can spread through bites of infected ticks. It can also be transmitted from animals to
humans through contact with blood, body fluids, or tissues of infected animals, mainly livestock such as cattle, sheep, goats, buffalo, and
camels. The most common symptoms in humans are headache, joint pain, vomiting, a flushed face, a red throat, and petechiae (red spots)
on the palate. The case fatality rate in hospitalized patients ranges from 9% to 50%. The last reported outbreak of CCHF in Senegal was in
2023 with seven cases and two deaths (CFR: 29%) reported from six of the fifteen regions in Senegal.
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
The MoH conducted outbreak investigations to establish the source of the outbreak. Additionally, the MoH has identified 11 contacts of the
case who are being monitored.

Description:
On 13 March 2024, the Ministry of Agriculture (MoAg) reported an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI H5N1) among 641
domestic poultry birds in a commercial farm in Ouagadougou. Since the beginning of the outbreak on 1 March 2024, a total of 581
confirmed cases and 441 deaths [case fatality rate (CFR: 75.9%)] have been reported among the poultry birds. The confirmatory test was
conducted using PCR at the National Veterinary Laboratory in Ouagadougou. In 2022, an outbreak of HPAI H5N1 affected 42 poultry
breeding sites, with more than 32,000 birds and 1.3 million eggs destroyed across seven of the thirteen regions in Burkina Faso.
Since its emergence, avian influenza viruses have become enzootic in some countries, infecting wild birds and continues to cause
outbreaks in poultry and sporadic human infections across a wide geographic area. These viruses occur naturally among wild aquatic birds
worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other bird and animal species. Wild aquatic birds are considered reservoirs (hosts) for avian
influenza. Susceptible birds become infected when they have contact with the virus as it is shed by infected birds and also through contact
with surfaces that are contaminated with virus from infected birds. There are two types: Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPAI) and Highly
Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI)
LPAI; Low pathogenic avian influenza viruses causes the disease with either no signs or mild disease in chickens/poultry. In poultry, some
low-pathogenic viruses can mutate into highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses.
HPAI; Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses cause severe disease and high mortality in infected poultry. Only some avian influenza
A(H5) and A(H7) viruses are classified as HPAI A viruses with mortality up to 90% to 100% in chickens, often within 48 hours. Both HPAI
and LPAI viruses can spread rapidly through poultry flocks and can cause mild to severe illness in infected humans. There are genetic and
antigenic differences between the influenza A virus subtypes that typically infect only birds and those that can infect birds and people.
Depopulation (culling), and quarantine of exposed birds as well as improved surveillance are the most preferred control measures during
outbreaks. The best means of protection for humans is to avoid sources of exposure to HPAI.
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
The MoAg coordinated the culling of 200 susceptible poultry birds in the farm to prevent further spread of the disease.

Description:
On 11 January 2024, the Uganda Ministry of Health (MoH) reported an outbreak of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever
(CCHF), in Kasagama sub-county, Lyantonde district, Uganda. The first confirmed case is a 45-year-old male butcher who
presented to Lyantonde district hospital with high-grade fever and severe bleeding through the oral cavity. A blood sample
sent to the Uganda Virus Research Institute tested positive for CCHF by polymerase chain reaction. Cumulatively, five cases
(1 confirmed; 4 probable) and three deaths* among the probable cases were reported from one of 146 districts in Uganda.
CCHF is a zoonotic viral haemorrhagic fever that can spread through bites of infected ticks. It can also be transmitted from
animals to humans through contact with blood, body fluids, or tissues of infected animals, mainly livestock such as cattle,
sheep, goats, buffalo, and camels. The most common symptoms in humans are headache, joint pain, vomiting, a flushed
face, a red throat, and petechiae (red spots) on the palate. The case fatality rate in hospitalized patients ranges from 9% to
50%. The last CCHF outbreak in Uganda occurred in October 2022, where three cases and two deaths were reported in
Amuru district
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
The MoH deployed a rapid response team to conduct epidemiological investigations and to institute outbreak response
interventions including active case search and risk communication, community engagement and social mobilization. A total of
12 contacts have been listed and are under follow-up. In addition, animal samples were submitted to the National Animal
Disease Diagnostics and Epidemiology Center laboratory for testing.

Description:
Since the beginning of this year, 2,008 cases (331 confirmed; 1,677 suspected) and 69 deaths [case fatality rate (CFR:
20.8%)] of Lassa fever were reported from three AU MS: Guinea (2; 1), Liberia (11; 0) and Nigeria (1,995 cases; 69 deaths).
This week, 511 new cases and 21 new deaths of Lassa fever were reported from Guinea, Liberia and Nigeria.
Guinea (initial report): On 12 February 2024, the MoH reported two confirmed cases and one death (CFR: 50%) of Lassa
fever from two districts. The index case was a 27-year-old female from Central Dandou district who presented with cough,
body weakness, nose and vaginal bleeding after childbirth at the Kissidougou health district. Blood samples collected from
the index case, tested positive for Lassa fever virus. The patient was managed and stabilized. The second case was a 40-
year-old male from Angola district who presented to the health care centre in N’Zerekore health district with headache, body
weakness, vomiting, abdominal pain, and gastroenteritis. He was confirmed positive for Lassa fever and later died.
Information on the type of test conducted and laboratory where the testing was performed were not provided. The last
outbreak of Lassa fever in Guinea occurred in November 2023 with a total of eight confirmed cases and three deaths (CFR:
37.5%) reported.
Liberia (initial report): “On 14 February 2024, the MoH reported 11 new cases (1 confirmed; 10 suspected) and no new
deaths of Lassa fever. The confirmed case was reported from Nimba county. This is a 75% decrease in the number of new
cases and 50% decrease in the number of new deaths compared to the same period last year. This is a protracted outbreak
that started in January 2022.
Nigeria: Since the last update (9 February 2024), the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) reported 498 new cases
(70 confirmed; 428 suspected) and 20 new deaths (CFR: 28.6%) of Lassa fever from 10 of 36 states and the federal capital
territory. This is a 29% decrease in the number of new cases and a 10% decrease in the number of new deaths compared to
the same period in 2023. Cumulatively, 1,995 cases (328 confirmed; 1,667 suspected) and 68 deaths (CFR: 20.7%) of Lassa
fever were reported from 20 of 36 states and the federal capital territory this year. Of the confirmed cases, 15 were
healthcare workers.
Lassa fever is a zoonotic, acute viral illness that is endemic in parts of West Africa, where the animal reservoir for the virus,
the “multimammate rat” (Mastomys natalensis), is distributed. Transmission of Lassa virus to humans occurs most commonly
through ingestion or inhalation of the virus in urine and droppings shed by Mastomys rodents. Nosocomial transmission can
occur in health care settings where appropriate infection prevention and control is not in place. Common symptoms include
fever, general malaise, headache, and signs of haemorrhage. About 1% of all Lassa virus infections result in death, although
mortality in hospitalised patients may be higher (approximately 15-20%).

Note: In 2023, 10,557 cases (1,292 confirmed; 9265 suspected) and 227 deaths (CFR: 17.4%) of Lassa fever were reported
from five AU MS: Ghana (27 cases; 1 death), Guinea (133; 3), Liberia (186; 5), Nigeria (10,425; 227) and Sierra Leone (6;
2).
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
Guinea and Liberia: The Ministries of Health continue to conduct active case search and risk communication activities in the
affected areas.
Nigeria: The NCDC activated the national Lassa fever multi-partner, multi-sectoral Emergency Operation Center (EOC) to
coordinate the response activities at national and sub-national levels.

Meningitis is an infection that causes inflammation of the meninges (the thin lining that surrounds the brain and the spinal
cord). Meningitis can present in bacterial, viral, fungal, parasitic, amoebic or non-infectious forms. Transmission is through
droplets of respiratory secretions from infected persons. The most common symptoms include fever, headache and stiffness
of the neck. Vaccines are available to prevent meningitis and are on the routine immunization schedule in most Member
States. Meningitis is endemic in Nigeria. However, it is seasonal starting from December all through to June with peaks
observed between March and April. The last outbreak of meningitis in Nigeria occurred in 2022 with 2,376 cases and 183
deaths (CFR: 7.7%) reported from 22 of 36 states and the federal capital territory.

Assessment
Description:
On 22 January 2024, the Ministry of Health (MoH) reported a confirmed case of Rift valley fever (RVF) in Nakaseke district,
central Uganda. The index case is a 45-year-old male butcher with a history of direct contact with dead animals. He
presented with fever, headache, loss of appetite, muscle pain, weakness, joint pain, confusion and nose bleeding, at the
Nakaseke district hospital. A blood sample collected from the case tested positive for RVF by polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) at the Uganda Virus Research Institute. The patient died on 14 January 2024. A concurrent RVF outbreak has been
reported in northern Kenya. However, there is no evidence of the two outbreaks being epi-linked.
Rift Valley fever is a zoonotic virus that causes acute viral haemorrhagic fever with an average case fatality rate of 1%. The
RVF virus can be transmitted to humans through contact with blood, body fluids, or tissues of infected animals, mainly
livestock such as cattle, sheep, goats, buffalo, and camels. It can also be transmitted through bites from infected mosquitoes
and rarely, from other biting insects. There is currently no treatment available for humans, but outbreaks of RVF can be
prevented by vaccinating at-risk human and animal populations. Since 2016, multiple outbreaks of RVF have been reported
in Uganda. In 2023, 20 cases and four deaths (CFR: 20%) were reported from Mbarara district, south-western Uganda.
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
The MoH deployed a rapid response team to conduct epidemiological investigations and to institute active surveillance in the
affected areas.

outbreak of RVF in Kenya occurred in 2021, with 32 cases and 11 deaths (CFR: 34%) were reported from Garissa and Isiolo
counties.
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
The MoH activated the regional PHEOC to coordinate the one health response and deployed a multi-sectoral rapid response
team to conduct epidemiological investigations. In addition, the MoH initiated enhanced syndromic surveillance to support
further case detection in the human and animal population.
