Assessment

Update to Event:
Since the beginning of this year, a total of 12,820 cases (7,592 confirmed; 5,228 suspected) and 535 deaths (CFR: 7.1%) of
diphtheria have been reported in four African Union (AU) Member States (MS): Algeria: (80 cases, 10 deaths), Guinea (288; 52),
Niger (865; 37) and Nigeria (11,587; 436).
This week, 507 new cases and four new deaths of diphtheria were reported from Guinea, Niger and Nigeria.
Guinea: Since the last update (8 September 2023), the MoH reported 114 new suspected cases and no new deaths of diphtheria
from Siguiri district in Kankan region. Cumulatively, 288 cases (14 confirmed; 274 suspected) and 52 deaths (CFR: 18.1%) have been
reported from all the four districts in Kankan region: Kankan (12 cases; 11 deaths), Kouroussa (3; 2), Mandian (13; 0) and Siguiri
(260; 39). Children between 1-4 years account for more than half (51.3%) of the cases. The national routine immunization coverage
for the third dose of pentavalent vaccine (which includes diphtheria vaccine) was 47% in 2022. This low coverage in the region, in a
context of large population movements due to mining, drives the outbreak.
Niger: Since the last update (1 September 2023), the MoH reported 70 new cases (3 confirmed; 67 suspected) and two new deaths
(CFR: 2.9%) of diphtheria. Cumulatively, 865 cases (360 confirmed; 505 suspected) and 37 deaths (CFR: 4.3%) have been reported
from 14 of 49 districts in Niger. Persons aged between 1-29 years account for 91% of all cases reported. Thirty-eight percent of the
total cases were vaccinated against diphtheria.
Nigeria: Since the last update (15 September 2023), the Nigeria Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (NCDC) reported 323
new suspected cases and two new deaths (CFR: 0.6%) of diphtheria. Cumulatively, 11,587 cases (7,202 confirmed; 4,385 suspected)
and 436 deaths (CFR: 3.8%) have been reported from 31 of 36 states of Nigeria. There has been a 41.5% average increase in the
number of new cases reported over the last four weeks. More than 71% of all cases were children between 1-14 years; 21% of whom
were fully vaccinated.
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
The Ministries of Health (MoHs) continue to enhance surveillance, case management and risk communication in affected districts.
Additionally, the MoHs continues the roll out of diphtheria vaccines in affected districts.
Africa CDC is organizing a diphtheria case management and infection prevention and control (IPC) training of trainers from 9 - 13
October 2023, in collaboration with the NCDC and Médecins Sans Frontiéres (MSF).

Update to Event:
As 28 September 2023, a total of 12,320,058 COVID-19 cases and 257,167 deaths (CFR: 2.1%) have been reported by the 55 African
Union Member States MS (first mention). This represents 2% of all cases and 4% of all deaths reported globally. Fifty-three MS have
reported COVID-19 cases infected with the Alpha (50 MS), Beta (45), Delta (53), Gamma (5) and Omicron (51) variants of concern
(VOC). Additionally, 32 MS have reported the presence of the Omicron BA.2 subvariant, 17 Member States reported the Omicron
sub lineage (XBB.1.5), 12 MS reported the Omicron sub lineage (BF.7 or BA.5.2.1.7), and 2 Member States have reported the
Omicron sub lineage (XBB.1.16). Another sub-variant of Omicron (B.1.1.529) called EG.5 has been detected and reported in Africa,
Americas, Asia, Europe and Oceania. As of 28 September 2023, nine Member States (Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Egypt,
Kenya, Mauritius, Morocco, South Africa, Tunisia and Uganda) have reported the presence of this new variant of interest (VOI).
Following an initial risk assessment conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO), the public health risk associated with
EG.5 is currently rated as low on a global level, similar to the risk of XBB.1.16 and other VOls. Fifty-four (98%) MS are currently
providing COVID-19 vaccination to the general population.
Cumulatively, 1.1 billion doses have been administered on the continent. Of these doses administered, 570.5 million people have
been partially vaccinated, and 453.8 million have been fully vaccinated. Eritrea is the only AU MS yet to start COVID-19 vaccination
roll out.
For Epi week 38 (18 - 24 September), 378 new COVID-19 cases were reported. The Northern region accounted for 54% of the new
COVID-19 cases reported this week, followed by the Central region (45%). No cases were reported in the Eastern and Southern
regions. Last week, no new COVID-19 deaths were reported in Africa. More than 4,500 new tests were conducted during the past
week. The weekly % test positivity increased from 7% to 8% compared to the previous week. Since February 2020, over 134 million
COVID-19 tests have been conducted in Africa.
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
The emergency operations center (EOC) of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) has been
activated for COVID-19 since 27 January 2020. For more information on Africa CDC’s response efforts please refer to Africa CDC’s
website, Hotspot dashboard, PGI Dashboard, Vaccination Dashboard and the Africa CDC COVID-19 brief.
