Assessment
Description:
On 22 January 2024, the Ministry of Health (MoH) reported a confirmed case of Rift valley fever (RVF) in Nakaseke district,
central Uganda. The index case is a 45-year-old male butcher with a history of direct contact with dead animals. He
presented with fever, headache, loss of appetite, muscle pain, weakness, joint pain, confusion and nose bleeding, at the
Nakaseke district hospital. A blood sample collected from the case tested positive for RVF by polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) at the Uganda Virus Research Institute. The patient died on 14 January 2024. A concurrent RVF outbreak has been
reported in northern Kenya. However, there is no evidence of the two outbreaks being epi-linked.
Rift Valley fever is a zoonotic virus that causes acute viral haemorrhagic fever with an average case fatality rate of 1%. The
RVF virus can be transmitted to humans through contact with blood, body fluids, or tissues of infected animals, mainly
livestock such as cattle, sheep, goats, buffalo, and camels. It can also be transmitted through bites from infected mosquitoes
and rarely, from other biting insects. There is currently no treatment available for humans, but outbreaks of RVF can be
prevented by vaccinating at-risk human and animal populations. Since 2016, multiple outbreaks of RVF have been reported
in Uganda. In 2023, 20 cases and four deaths (CFR: 20%) were reported from Mbarara district, south-western Uganda.
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
The MoH deployed a rapid response team to conduct epidemiological investigations and to institute active surveillance in the
affected areas.

Assessment Assessment
Description:
On 24 January 2024, the MOH reported a case of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in Marsabit county, northern Kenya. The case is a
38-year-old female who presented with febrile illness and general body weakness at Marsabit Central Referral Hospital. A
blood sample collected from the case tested positive for RVF by PCR at the Kenya Medical Research Institute. The last
outbreak of RVF in Kenya occurred in 2021, with 32 cases and 11 deaths (CFR: 34%) were reported from Garissa and Isiolo
counties.
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
The MoH activated the regional PHEOC to coordinate the one health response and deployed a multi-sectoral rapid response
team to conduct epidemiological investigations. In addition, the MoH initiated enhanced syndromic surveillance to support
further case detection in the human and animal population.

three deaths were reported from Guinea and Nigeria.
Guinea: Since the beginning of the year, the MoH reported 308 new suspected and three new deaths of diphtheria (CFR:
0.9%) from two of the eight regions. This is a protracted outbreak which started in July 2023 with a total of 2,984 cases (39
confirmed; 2,945 suspected) and 94 deaths (CFR: 3.1%) reported since the start of the outbreak . Of the total cases, the
most affected age group is 15- years and above accounting for 31%, while females account for 66%. Additionally, none of
the reported cases have been fully vaccinated against diphtheria.
Nigeria: Since the last update, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) reported 368 new cases (309 confirmed; 59

affected areas.

response activities in the country.
