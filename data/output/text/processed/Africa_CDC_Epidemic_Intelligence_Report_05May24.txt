Assessment Assessment N/A
Description:
On 28 February 2024, the Chad Ministry of Health (MoH) reported an outbreak of hepatitis E among refugee and host communities in two
health districts in Quaddai province. Between 2 January to 15 February 2024, eight samples tested positive for hepatitis E by polymerase chain
reaction, at the Institut Pasteur Dakar. As of 31 March 2024, a total of 1,466 cases (36 confirmed; 1,430 suspected) and four deaths [case
fatality rate (CFR: 0.27%)] have been reported in five refugee camps and two refugee hosting sites, in Adré (1,331 cases; 4 deaths) and Hadjer-
Hadid (115; 0) health districts. Twenty-five cases and two deaths were reported among pregnant women. In addition, 55% percent of the cases
were males and children <4 years accounted for 31% of the total confirmed cases.
Hepatitis E is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV) and typically presents as acute jaundice. In most people, HEV infection
results in a self-limited, acute illness. However, acute infection can become chronic in rare cases, primarily in people who have received solid-
organ transplants. HEV is typically transmitted by the fecal-oral route. Prevention includes good sanitation and the availability of clean drinking
water. People living in crowded camps or temporary housing, including refugees and internally displaced persons, are at particularly high risk.
HEV is endemic in Chad, particularly in the Tangile region, which last experienced an outbreak in 2022.
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
The MoH organized coordination meetings at the district level and activated the incident management system. In addition, water, sanitation and
hygiene, active case finding, and risk communication and community engagement activities are ongoing in the affected health districts.
