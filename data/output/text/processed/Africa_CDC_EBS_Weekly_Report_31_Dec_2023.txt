Assessment

Description:

On 10 December 2023, the Ministry of Health (MoH) reported two confirmed cases and no deaths of Zika virus from Fatick and Sédhiou
regions. On 13 November 2023, the index case who was a female of unspecified age presented with fever, headache, and eye pain, at
Sokone district hospital, Fatick region. The second case was an 18-year-old male who presented with similar symptoms at Sedhiou
hospital in Sédhiou region. The cases were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction at the Institut Pasteur, Dakar.
A serosurvey conducted between 2011 and 2012 among 2 to 29-year-old-subjects in three Member States (MS) sharing borders: Gambia,
Mali and Senegal; confirmed the presence of Zika virus circulating in these MS with the highest prevalence reported among those between
11-17 years old in Senegal (22.7%). On 6 December 2023, Mali reported 12 confirmed cases and no deaths of Zika virus.
Zika virus is a mosquito borne virus transmitted by aedes mosquito through bite during the daytime. Since the 1960s, sporadic infections
among humans were being recorded in Africa and Asian countries. However, in 2007, multiple outbreaks were reported in various countries
globally. Zika virus has also been found to be associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome. Persons infected with Zika rarely show symptoms.
However, mild symptoms might show 3 - 14 days after infection and can last for between 2 — 7 days. During pregnancy, Zika virus infection
can cause microcephaly and other congenital malformations in the infant. There is no specific treatment for Zika, and no vaccine has been
approved for the prevention or treatment of Zika virus infection. Elimination of mosquito breeding sites and use of protective clothing
remains the best prevention methods.

Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
The MoH is conducting active surveillance at 23 community sentinel surveillance sites for arboviruses located in the 14 regions of the
country. Additionally, Zika virus has been integrated with the routine measles surveillance.

Assessment
Description:
On 27 December 2023, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) reported 22 deaths as a result of landslide due to heavy rainfall in Kasai-
Central province. In addition, multiple homes have been destroyed. The affected homes were built at the foot of a mountain making them
vulnerable to heavy rains and floods. The last landslide event occurred in DRC in September 2023, where 17 deaths and multiple injuries
were reported from Mongala province.
Landslides are a type of mass wasting, which denotes any down-slope movement of soil and rocks under the direct influence of gravity and
are often associated with a high number of mortalities, injuries and destruction of property and basic infrastructure. Landslides are often
reported in DRC, often triggered by heavy rainfall and accompanied by flooding.
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
The Government of DRC has deployed a multi-sectoral team to conduct a risk assessment to establish the extent of the damage and
intensify search and rescue operations
