haemorrhagic fever (CCHF). The confirmed case was a 58-year-old male resident in North, who presented to Cabinet
Insan health facility with fever on 17 July 2023. Following non-responsiveness to treatment, he was transferred to
Dakar, Senegal where he was hospitalized at the National Hospital Center of Pikine for treatment. On 24 July 2023,
blood samples sent to the Pasteur Institute in Dakar tested positive for CCHF virus by polymerase chain reaction
(PCR). On 26 July, The case died and repatriated to Mauritania on 28 July. Outcome of investigations revealed
that, the case had a history of contact with infected camels in Moughataa.
CCHF is a zoonotic viral hemorrhagic fever that can spread through bites of infected ticks. It can also be transmitted
from animals to humans through contact with blood, body fluids, or tissues of infected animals, mainly livestock such
as cattle, sheep, goats, buffalo, and camels. The most common symptoms in humans are fever, headache, joint pain,
vomiting, and signs of hemorrhage. The case fatality rate (CFR) in hospitalized patients ranges from 9% to 50%.
CCHF is endemic in Mauritania; the last outbreak occurred in August 2022.
Response by MS/Partners:
A Joint mission composed of MoH/Ministry of Agriculture and World Health Organization was launched to investigate
the outbreak. Cumulatively, 108 contacts of the confirmed index case have been listed. The MoH continues to
enhance surveillance, active case search and community sensitization.

Description:

On the 2nd of August 2023, the Algeria Ministry of Health (MoH), reported 80 Diphtheria cases (64 suspected and 16
confirmed) with no deaths in the southern city of Tamanrasset. Most cases were foreigners who were not vaccinated
against Diphtheria from neighboring countries residing in Tamanrasset (at the border areas with the countries of
Sahel).

Diphtheria is a bacterial infection caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, a toxin producing bacteria. Person to
person transmission is usually through respiratory droplets (respiratory form) and contact with infected sores and
ulcers on the skin (cutaneous form). Symptoms for the respiratory form include weakness, sore throat, fever, swollen
lymph nodes, difficulty in breathing, and death in more severe cases. The overall case-fatality rate for the respiratory
form of diphtheria is between 5%-—10%, with higher death rates (up to 20%) among persons younger than 5 or older
than 40 years of age. Laboratory diagnosis is made via bacterial culture, Elek test or polymerase chain reaction
(PCR). Treatment includes antibiotic therapy. Vaccines are available to protect against infection and typically given in
four doses as part of routine immunization programs. The last outbreak of Diphtheria in Algeria occurred in August
2022.

Response by MS/Partners:

The MoH deployed a rapid response team (RRT) to the affected area to conduct case management, risk
communication and vaccination of the affected community. According to media reports, a crisis response unit has
been set up and over 10000 foreigners have been vaccinated against Diphtheria.
