Health Assessment

Description:
On 23 May 2023, the Ministry of Health (MoH), Namibia reported an outbreak of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) following
laboratory confirmation in a male patient at Windhoek Central Hospital. The confirmation was made by the National Institute for
Communicable Diseases of South Africa. The index case presented with bleeding gums and headache at a clinic in Gobabis,
Omaheke region, eastern Namibia on 16 May 2023. He was later transferred to Windhoek Central Hospital, where he died on 18 May
2023.
CCHF is a zoonotic viral hemorrhagic fever that can spread through bites of infected ticks. It can also be transmitted from animals to
humans through contact with blood, body fluids, or tissues of infected animals, mainly livestock such as cattle, sheep, goats,
buffalo and camels. Although livestock can be infected with the virus, most do not manifest clinical symptoms. There is currently no
approved safe and effective vaccine for human use, and treatment for CCHF is primarily supportive. The last outbreak of CCHF in
Namibia occurred in 2020, with two cases and no deaths from Oshkoto and Omusati regions.

Response:
The MoH has deployed a team to the field to investigate this outbreak. A total of 27 contacts have been identified including 24 health
workers. In addition, emergency management committees have been established in Khomas and Omaheke regions, risk
communication and community engagements are ongoing in affected communities, and the veterinary department has been engaged
to institute control measures in livestock.
