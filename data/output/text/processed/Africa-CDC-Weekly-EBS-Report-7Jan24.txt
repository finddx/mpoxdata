Assessment
Description:
On 1 January 2024, the National Bureau of Risk and Disaster Management (BNGRC) reported the occurrence of floods
caused by the landfall of tropical storm Alvaro over the southwestern-central coast of Madagascar. A total of 10 deaths and
9,528 displaced persons across five of 22 regions in Madagascar have been reported. In addition, an estimated 25,837
persons have been affected by the floods and 59 classrooms have been completely damaged.
A flash flood is a rapid flooding of low-lying areas. It may be caused by heavy rain associated with a severe thunderstorm,
hurricane, or tropical storm. Flash floods are a significant hazard with potential to cause fatalities and displacement of people.
Flash floods can also deposit large quantities of sediments on floodplains.
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
BNGRC activated the emergency operations centre and continues to issue cyclone warning instructions. In addition, the
BNGRC has deployed a rapid response team to coordinate the response in the affected regions; including evacuation of
displaced persons, mapping of areas impacted by the floods, public health awareness.
