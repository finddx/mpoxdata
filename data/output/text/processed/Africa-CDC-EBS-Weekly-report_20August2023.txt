three Member States (Cape Verde, South Africa and Uganda) have reported the presence of this new variant of interest (VOI). Following
an initial risk assessment conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO), the public health risk associated with EG.5 is currently
rated as low on a global level, similar to the risk of XBB.1.16 and other VOls.
Fifty-four (98%) MS are currently providing COVID-19 vaccination to the general population. Cumulatively, 1.1 billion doses have been
