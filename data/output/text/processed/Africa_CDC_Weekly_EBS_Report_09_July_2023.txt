Description:
On 3 July 2023, an outbreak of a suspected hemorrhagic fever was reported from Longechuk county, Upper Nile
state, north eastern South Sudan. Suspected cases were first identified on 16 June 2023, during routine supportive
supervision activities conducted by the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Dajo primary health care unit, northern Longechuk
county. The cases presented with bloody diarrhoea, vomiting blood, general body weakness, cough, body rash, loss
of appetite, red eyes and swollen faces. All 14 samples tested at the National Public Health Laboratory, Juba, were
negative for Ebola virus disease, Marburg virus disease, yellow fever, Rift Valley fever, dengue fever and Crimean-
Congo haemorrhagic fever.
As of 5 July 2023, a total of 150 suspected cases and 23 deaths (case fatality rate [CFR]: 15.3%) have been reported
from Upper Nile state. Majority of the deaths (60%) occurred among children and these were reported from Pashimbi
(43%) and Dajo (17%).
Response:
The MoH convened an urgent partner meeting to plan the response and deployed a rapid response team (RRT) to
Upper Nile state to conduct further epidemiological investigations. In addition, the MoH plans to collect additional
samples for further laboratory investigation.
The Africa CDC Epidemic Intelligence team held an emergency meeting with the South Sudan MoH to verify the
reports and explore potential areas of support for the response.

Ethiopian PHI Source GeoScope Risk Assessment
Description:
Since epidemiological (Epi) week 15 (10 - 16 April 2023), the Ethiopian Public Health Institute (EPHI) has reported a
total of 6,238 cases (64 confirmed; 6,174 suspected) and four deaths (CFR: 6.3%) of dengue fever from Afar region
and Dire Dewa city administration. Majority (98%) of the cases are from Afar region.
Dengue is an arbovirus in the Filiviridae family, transmitted primarily by Aedes mosquitoes. Aedes mosquitoes are
responsible for transmitting chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus. There are four distinct, but closely related,
serotypes of the virus (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4). The average CFR of dengue is less than 1%, but
can be up to 15% if untreated. Recovery from infection is believed to confer lifelong immunity against a serotype. The
last outbreak of dengue fever in Ethiopia occurred in 2019 where 1,251 cases and no deaths were reported from Afar
region.
Response:
The EPHI activated the regional emergency operations centers (EOCs) to coordinate the response and continues to
conduct enhanced surveillance and case management at designated treatment centers. In addition, vector control
activities are ongoing in the affected regions.
