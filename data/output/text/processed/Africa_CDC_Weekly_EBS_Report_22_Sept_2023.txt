have been reported by the 55 African Union Member States MS (first mention). This represents 2% of all cases and 4% of all deaths
reported globally. Fifty-three MS have reported COVID-19 cases infected with the Alpha (50 MS), Beta (45), Delta (53), Gamma

Central African Republic, Egypt, Kenya, South Africa, Tunisia and Uganda) have reported the presence of this new variant of interest
(VOI). Following an initial risk assessment conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO), the public health risk associated with
EG.5 is currently rated as low on a global level, similar to the risk of XBB.1.16 and other VOls. Fifty-four (98%) MS are currently
providing COVID-19 vaccination to the general population.
Cumulatively, 1.1 billion doses have been administered on the continent. Of these doses administered, 570.5 million people have
been partially vaccinated, and 453.8 million have been fully vaccinated. Eritrea is the only AU MS yet to start COVID-19 vaccination roll
