ratio [CFR]: 2.1%) were reported by the 55 African Union (AU) Member States (MS). This represents 2% of all cases and 4% of all
deaths reported globally. Forty-four (80%) AU MS are reporting case fatality rates (CFR) higher than the global CFR. Fifty three MS

concern (VOC). Additionally, 32 MS have reported the presence of the Omicron BA.2 sub-variant, 17 Member States reported the
Omicron sublineage (XBB.1.5), 12 MS reported the Omicron sublineage (BF.7 or BA.5.2.1.7), and 2 Member States are now reporting
the Omicron sublineage (XBB.1.16).
Fifty-four (98%) MS are currently providing COVID-19 vaccination to the general population. Cumulatively, 1.1 billion doses have
been administered on the continent. Of these doses administered, 546.5 million people have been partially vaccinated, and 431.7
million have been fully vaccinated. Eritrea is the only AU MS yet to start COVID-19 vaccination roll out.
For Epi week 18 (4 - 10 May 2023), 1,441 new COVID-19 cases were reported, which is an 11% increase in the number of new cases
reported compared to the previous week (17). The Northern region accounted for 54% of the new COVID-19 cases reported this
