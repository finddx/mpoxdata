Description:
On 26 October 2023, the Uganda Ministry of Health (MoH) reported an outbreak of anthrax in Kween district, eastern Uganda. The
index case was a 42-year-old casual laborer who presented with eschars. Samples collected and submitted to the Uganda Virus
Research Institute, Arua, tested positive for anthrax. Cumulatively, five cases (3 confirmed; 2 suspected) and no deaths have been
reported. In addition, the occurrence of 10 sudden animal deaths have been reported in Kween district.
Anthrax is a zoonotic bacterial infection and can spread to humans through inhalation, handling, eating and drinking foods
contaminated with bacterial spores. Clinical presentations may vary from cutaneous, inhalation, gastrointestinal and injection types
of anthrax. The average CFR ranges from 20% - 30% in cutaneous anthrax without antibiotic treatment and 25% - 75% for
gastrointestinal anthrax, 80% or higher in inhalation anthrax.
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
The MoH continues to conduct enhanced surveillance and risk communication in the affected district.

Update to Event:
Since January 2023, a total of 15,852 cases (9,876 confirmed; 5,976 suspected) and 656 deaths (CFR: 6.6%) of diphtheria have
been reported in four African Union Member States (MS): Algeria (80 cases; 10 deaths), Guinea (417; 60), Mauritania (8; 4), Niger
(865; 37) and Nigeria (14,482; 545). This week, eight new cases and four new deaths from diphtheria (CFR: 50%) were reported
from Mauritania.
Mauritania: On 24 October 2023, the Ministry of Health (MoH), Mauritania reported an outbreak of diphtheria with eight suspected
cases and 4 deaths (CFR: 50%). The cases were reported from Bassiknou district in Hodh El Chargui province close to the border
with Mali. On 19 October 2023, the index case presented at Bassiknou hospital with fever, sore throat, swollen tonsils and difficulty
in breathing. All eight samples tested negative by bacterial culture at the National Public Health laboratory, Mauritania. However,
this could have been due to suboptimal storage conditions while transporting the samples to the laboratory. The cases are between
1 - 15 years old, and majority (63%) are unvaccinated. Poor vaccination coverage, especially in the affected area, was identified as
a risk factor for this outbreak.
Diphtheria is a bacterial infection caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, a toxin producing bacteria. Diphtheria manifests in two
forms: respiratory (most commonly seen) and cutaneous. Person to person transmission is usually through respiratory droplets
(respiratory form) and contact with infected sores and ulcers on the skin (cutaneous form). Symptoms for the respiratory form
include weakness, sore throat, fever, swollen lymph nodes, difficulty breathing, and death in more severe cases. The toxin produced
by the bacteria destroys healthy respiratory tissues forming a thick gray coating on the throat, tonsils and nose making it difficult to
breathe and swallow. The toxin can also affect the heart, nervous system, and kidneys if infection is systemic. The overall case-
fatality rate for the respiratory form of diphtheria is between 5% and 10%, with higher death rates (up to 20%) among persons
younger than five or older than 40 years of age. Laboratory diagnosis is made via bacterial culture, Elek test or polymerase chain
reaction (PCR). Treatment includes anti-toxins and antibiotic therapy. Vaccines are available to protect against infection and
typically given in four doses as part of routine immunization programs.
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
Mauritania: The MoH activated the EOC and deployed a rapid response team for active case finding case management and mass
sensitization of local communities' leaders involved in health education.

are currently providing COVID-19 vaccination to the general population. Cumulatively, 1.1 billion doses have been administered on
the continent. Of these doses administered, 570.8 million people have been partially vaccinated, and 446.9 million have been fully
