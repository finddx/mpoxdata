Assessment N/A
Description:
On 9 July 2024, the MoH reported one confirmed case and no deaths of Rift Valley fever (RVF) from Kidira district, Tambacounda region. The
case is a 30 year-old female who presented to the Kidira health facilty with symptoms of fever, headache, general body weakness, joint pain,
and retro-orbital pain. Blood sample was collected and tested at the Institut Pasteur in Dakar using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay which
was confirmed positive for RVF. The case was managed and has been stabilized. No animal case of RVF was reported around the vicinity of
the case.
RVF is a vector-borne, viral Zoonotic disease. It can be transmitted to humans through contact with blood/organs of infected animals or bites
from infected mosquitoes. Infected persons often present with mild symptoms including joint pain, flu-like fever, muscle pain, loss of appetite,
and headache. Severe infections can result in deaths; however, the case fatality rate is generally below 1%. The last case of RVF in Senegal
was reported in June 2023 among wild animals, with three confirmed cases and two deaths (CFR: 67%) in Guembeul natural reserve, Gandiol
region.
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
The MoH coordinated a multisectoral and multidisciplinary team to investigate and respond to the outbreak through active case search and risk communication. Additionally,
nine contacts have been identified and are being monitored.
