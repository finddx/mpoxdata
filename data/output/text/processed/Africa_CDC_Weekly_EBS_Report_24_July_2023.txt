Health Assessment
Description:
On 16 July 2023, the Ministry of Health (MoH) ,Cote d’lvoire reported an oubtreak of dengue fever with 107 cases (22 confirmed; 85
suspected) and no deaths from the country. Confirmatory diagnosis was made at the Institut Pasteur in Dakar by polymerase chain
reaction (PCR). The cases were reported from four of the 14 districts: Cocody-Bingerville, Soubre, Treichville-Marcory and Yopougon
Ouest, with Cocody-Bingerville accounting for 95% of the total cases reported.
Dengue is an arbovirus in the Fliviridae family, transmitted primarily by Aedes mosquitoes. Aedes mosquitoes are responsible for
transmitting chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus. There are four distinct, but closely related, serotypes of the virus (DENV-1,
DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4). The average CFR of dengue is less than 1%, but can be up to 15% if untreated. Recovery from
infection is believed to confer lifelong immunity against a serotype. The virus is endemic in tropical areas of Africa, the Americas, the
Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia and the Western Pacific
Response:
The MoH is conducting clinical management of cases. In addition, risk communication and vector control activities in the most
affected area of Cocody-Bingerville — Adjame are ongoing.
