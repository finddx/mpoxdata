Update to Event:
As of 6 p.m. East African Time (EAT) 24 August 2023, a total of 12,314,546 COVID-19 cases and 258,500 deaths (CFR: 2.1%)
have been reported by the 55 AU MS. This represents 2% of all cases and 4% of all deaths reported globally.
Fifty-three MS have reported COVID-19 cases infected with the Alpha (50 MS), Beta (45), Delta (53), Gamma (5) and Omicron
(51) variants of concern (VOC). Additionally, 32 MS have reported the presence of the Omicron BA.2 subvariant, 17 Member
States reported the Omicron sub lineage (XBB.1.5), 12 MS reported the Omicron sub lineage (BF.7 or BA.5.2.1.7), and 2 Member
States have reported the Omicron sub lineage (XBB.1.16). Another subvariant of Omicron (B.1.1.529) called EG.5 has been
detected and reported in Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe and Oceania. As of 24 August 2023, four Member States (Cape Verde,
Egypt, South Africa and Uganda) have reported the presence of this new variant of interest (VOI). Following an initial risk
assessment conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO), the public health risk associated with EG.5 is currently rated as
low on a global level, similar to the risk of XBB.1.16 and other VOls.
Fifty-four (98%) MS are currently providing COVID-19 vaccination to the general population. Cumulatively, 1.1 billion doses have
been administered on the continent. Of these doses administered, 570.5 million people have been partially vaccinated, and 453.8
million have been fully vaccinated. Eritrea is the only AU MS yet to start COVID-19 vaccination roll out.
For Epi week 33 (14 - 20 August 2023), 124 new COVID-19 cases were reported, which is a 13% decrease in the number of new
cases reported compared to the previous week (32). The Northern region accounted for 60% of the new COVID-19 cases
reported this week, followed by the Central (28%), Western (10%), Southern (2%) and no case reported in Eastern region.
Last week, four new COVID-19 deaths were reported in Africa. More than two thousand new tests were conducted during the past
week. The weekly % test positivity decreased from 7% to 6% compared to the previous week. Since February 2020, over 133
million COVID-19 tests have been conducted in Africa.
