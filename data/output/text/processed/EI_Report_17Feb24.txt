Description:
On 11 January 2024, the Uganda Ministry of Health (MoH) reported an outbreak of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever
(CCHF), in Kasagama sub-county, Lyantonde district, Uganda. The first confirmed case is a 45-year-old male butcher who
presented to Lyantonde district hospital with high-grade fever and severe bleeding through the oral cavity. A blood sample
sent to the Uganda Virus Research Institute tested positive for CCHF by polymerase chain reaction. Cumulatively, five cases
(1 confirmed; 4 probable) and three deaths* among the probable cases were reported from one of 146 districts in Uganda.
CCHF is a zoonotic viral haemorrhagic fever that can spread through bites of infected ticks. It can also be transmitted from
animals to humans through contact with blood, body fluids, or tissues of infected animals, mainly livestock such as cattle,
sheep, goats, buffalo, and camels. The most common symptoms in humans are headache, joint pain, vomiting, a flushed
face, a red throat, and petechiae (red spots) on the palate. The case fatality rate in hospitalized patients ranges from 9% to
50%. The last CCHF outbreak in Uganda occurred in October 2022, where three cases and two deaths were reported in
Amuru district
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
The MoH deployed a rapid response team to conduct epidemiological investigations and to institute outbreak response
interventions including active case search and risk communication, community engagement and social mobilization. A total of
12 contacts have been listed and are under follow-up. In addition, animal samples were submitted to the National Animal
Disease Diagnostics and Epidemiology Center laboratory for testing.

Description:
Since the beginning of this year, 2,008 cases (331 confirmed; 1,677 suspected) and 69 deaths [case fatality rate (CFR:
20.8%)] of Lassa fever were reported from three AU MS: Guinea (2; 1), Liberia (11; 0) and Nigeria (1,995 cases; 69 deaths).
This week, 511 new cases and 21 new deaths of Lassa fever were reported from Guinea, Liberia and Nigeria.
Guinea (initial report): On 12 February 2024, the MoH reported two confirmed cases and one death (CFR: 50%) of Lassa
fever from two districts. The index case was a 27-year-old female from Central Dandou district who presented with cough,
body weakness, nose and vaginal bleeding after childbirth at the Kissidougou health district. Blood samples collected from
the index case, tested positive for Lassa fever virus. The patient was managed and stabilized. The second case was a 40-
year-old male from Angola district who presented to the health care centre in N’Zerekore health district with headache, body
weakness, vomiting, abdominal pain, and gastroenteritis. He was confirmed positive for Lassa fever and later died.
Information on the type of test conducted and laboratory where the testing was performed were not provided. The last
outbreak of Lassa fever in Guinea occurred in November 2023 with a total of eight confirmed cases and three deaths (CFR:
37.5%) reported.
Liberia (initial report): “On 14 February 2024, the MoH reported 11 new cases (1 confirmed; 10 suspected) and no new
deaths of Lassa fever. The confirmed case was reported from Nimba county. This is a 75% decrease in the number of new
cases and 50% decrease in the number of new deaths compared to the same period last year. This is a protracted outbreak
that started in January 2022.
Nigeria: Since the last update (9 February 2024), the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) reported 498 new cases
(70 confirmed; 428 suspected) and 20 new deaths (CFR: 28.6%) of Lassa fever from 10 of 36 states and the federal capital
territory. This is a 29% decrease in the number of new cases and a 10% decrease in the number of new deaths compared to
the same period in 2023. Cumulatively, 1,995 cases (328 confirmed; 1,667 suspected) and 68 deaths (CFR: 20.7%) of Lassa
fever were reported from 20 of 36 states and the federal capital territory this year. Of the confirmed cases, 15 were
healthcare workers.
Lassa fever is a zoonotic, acute viral illness that is endemic in parts of West Africa, where the animal reservoir for the virus,
the “multimammate rat” (Mastomys natalensis), is distributed. Transmission of Lassa virus to humans occurs most commonly
through ingestion or inhalation of the virus in urine and droppings shed by Mastomys rodents. Nosocomial transmission can
occur in health care settings where appropriate infection prevention and control is not in place. Common symptoms include
fever, general malaise, headache, and signs of haemorrhage. About 1% of all Lassa virus infections result in death, although
mortality in hospitalised patients may be higher (approximately 15-20%).

Note: In 2023, 10,557 cases (1,292 confirmed; 9265 suspected) and 227 deaths (CFR: 17.4%) of Lassa fever were reported
from five AU MS: Ghana (27 cases; 1 death), Guinea (133; 3), Liberia (186; 5), Nigeria (10,425; 227) and Sierra Leone (6;
2).
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
Guinea and Liberia: The Ministries of Health continue to conduct active case search and risk communication activities in the
affected areas.
Nigeria: The NCDC activated the national Lassa fever multi-partner, multi-sectoral Emergency Operation Center (EOC) to
coordinate the response activities at national and sub-national levels.

Description:
Since the beginning of this year, the Uganda MoH reported 25 new cases (7 confirmed; 3 probable; 15 suspected) and
three new deaths among confirmed cases (CFR: 42.9%) of anthrax from three of 146 districts in Uganda: Kazo (22 cases; 3
deaths), Kyotera (1; 0) and Ibanda (2; 0). In addition, 177 suspected animal deaths of anthrax were reported from Kazo
district. This is a protracted outbreak that started in July 2023.
Anthrax is a zoonotic bacterial infection and can spread to humans through inhalation, handling eating and drinking foods
contaminated with bacterial spores. Clinical presentations may vary from cutaneous, inhalation, gastrointestinal and injection
types of anthrax. The average CFR ranges from 20%-30% in cutaneous anthrax without antibiotic treatment and 25 - 75% for
gastrointestinal anthrax, 80% or higher in inhalation anthrax.
