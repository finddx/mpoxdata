Description:
On 24 November 2023, the Kenya Ministry of Health (MoH) reported the occurrence of floods caused by heavy rainfall
attributed to the El Nino phenomenon. As of 29 November 2023, the floods have led to 85 deaths and displacement of
315,217 persons in 33 of the 47 counties in Kenya. In addition, a total of 16 missing persons and 205 injuries have been
reported across multiple counties. Health services in 19 counties were disrupted as a result of the flood. Affected counties are
at risk of vector and water borne diseases.
Floods are the most frequent type of natural disaster and occur when an overflow of water submerges land that is usually dry.
Floods are often caused by heavy rainfall and have potential to cause widespread devastation including loss of lives and
damages to personal property and infrastructure.
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
The MoH activated the national and county public health emergency operations centres (PHEOC) and developed the El Nino
contingency plan. In addition, risk communication, enhanced disease surveillance, provision of water, sanitation and hygiene
supplies, mapping and repair of affected infrastructure and prepositioning of cholera kits are some of the ongoing
interventions, led by the government with support from partners.
