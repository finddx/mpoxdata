Description:
On 28 February 2024, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) reported 628 cases (59 confirmed; 569 suspected) and
78 deaths [case fatality rate (CFR)]: 12.42%) from five of 36 states and the federal capital territory. Cumulatively, since the
beginning of 2023, a total of 710 cases and 84 deaths (CFR: 11.8%) have been reported in Nigeria.
Meningitis is an infection that causes inflammation of the meninges (the thin lining that surrounds the brain and the spinal
cord). Meningitis can present in bacterial, viral, fungal, parasitic, amoebic or non-infectious forms. Transmission is through
droplets of respiratory secretions from infected persons. The most common symptoms include fever, headache and stiffness
of the neck. Vaccines are available to prevent meningitis and are on the routine immunization schedule in most Member
States. Meningitis is endemic in Nigeria. However, it is seasonal starting from December all through to June with peaks
observed between March and April. The last outbreak of meningitis in Nigeria occurred in 2022 with 2,376 cases and 183
deaths (CFR: 7.7%) reported from 22 of 36 states and the federal capital territory.
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
The NCDC plans to build capacity for case management, sample collection, transportation, laboratory diagnosis and data
management.
