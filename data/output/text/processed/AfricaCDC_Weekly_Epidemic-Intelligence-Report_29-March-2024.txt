Moderate Risk Events

CCHF virus in Senegal

1 confirmed human case(s)

0 human deaths (CFR: 0%)

Agent/Pathogen CCHF virus First Reported 28-Mar-2024 First Occurred 21-Mar-2024

Country Senegal Location Dakar Source Ministry of Health
Human Risk Animal Risk

Description:
On 22 March 2024, the Ministry of Health (MoH) reported one confirmed case and no deaths of Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF)
from Dakar. The case was a 25-year-old male animal breeder from Ndoffanne district. He reported to the national hospital in Dakar with
symptoms of high fever, skin rashes and he was also bleeding. Blood sample collected from the case tested positive for CCHF by
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at the Institut Pasteur de Dakar. The case has been managed and stabilized.
CCHF is a zoonotic viral hemorrhagic fever that can spread through bites of infected ticks. It can also be transmitted from animals to
humans through contact with blood, body fluids, or tissues of infected animals, mainly livestock such as cattle, sheep, goats, buffalo, and
camels. The most common symptoms in humans are headache, joint pain, vomiting, a flushed face, a red throat, and petechiae (red spots)
on the palate. The case fatality rate in hospitalized patients ranges from 9% to 50%. The last reported outbreak of CCHF in Senegal was in
2023 with seven cases and two deaths (CFR: 29%) reported from six of the fifteen regions in Senegal.
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
The MoH conducted outbreak investigations to establish the source of the outbreak. Additionally, the MoH has identified 11 contacts of the
case who are being monitored.

Human Risk Animal Risk

Description:
On 13 March 2024, the Ministry of Agriculture (MoAg) reported an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI H5N1) among 641
domestic poultry birds in a commercial farm in Ouagadougou. Since the beginning of the outbreak on 1 March 2024, a total of 581
confirmed cases and 441 deaths [case fatality rate (CFR: 75.9%)] have been reported among the poultry birds. The confirmatory test was
conducted using PCR at the National Veterinary Laboratory in Ouagadougou. In 2022, an outbreak of HPAI H5N1 affected 42 poultry
breeding sites, with more than 32,000 birds and 1.3 million eggs destroyed across seven of the thirteen regions in Burkina Faso.
Since its emergence, avian influenza viruses have become enzootic in some countries, infecting wild birds and continues to cause
outbreaks in poultry and sporadic human infections across a wide geographic area. These viruses occur naturally among wild aquatic birds
worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other bird and animal species. Wild aquatic birds are considered reservoirs (hosts) for avian
influenza. Susceptible birds become infected when they have contact with the virus as it is shed by infected birds and also through contact
with surfaces that are contaminated with virus from infected birds. There are two types: Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPAI) and Highly
Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI)
LPAI; Low pathogenic avian influenza viruses causes the disease with either no signs or mild disease in chickens/poultry. In poultry, some
low-pathogenic viruses can mutate into highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses.
HPAI; Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses cause severe disease and high mortality in infected poultry. Only some avian influenza
A(H5) and A(H7) viruses are classified as HPAI A viruses with mortality up to 90% to 100% in chickens, often within 48 hours. Both HPAI
and LPAI viruses can spread rapidly through poultry flocks and can cause mild to severe illness in infected humans. There are genetic and
antigenic differences between the influenza A virus subtypes that typically infect only birds and those that can infect birds and people.
Depopulation (culling), and quarantine of exposed birds as well as improved surveillance are the most preferred control measures during
outbreaks. The best means of protection for humans is to avoid sources of exposure to HPAI.
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
The MoAg coordinated the culling of 200 susceptible poultry birds in the farm to prevent further spread of the disease.
