Animal Risk
Assessment
Description:
Since the beginning of this year, a total of 709 human cases (3 confirmed; 706 suspected), four suspected and no confirmed
deaths of anthrax have been reported in three African Union Member States (AU MS): Uganda (5 human cases; 0 deaths),
Zambia (335; 4*) and Zimbabwe (369; 0). In addition, two AU MS (Ghana and Nigeria) have reported anthrax outbreaks in
animals. This week, 397 new human cases and four deaths among suspected cases of anthrax were reported from
Zambia and Zimbabwe.
Zambia: On 1 November 2023, Zambia Ministry of Health (MoH) reported 335 suspected cases with four deaths (1.2%) of
anthrax from six provinces: Eastern (30 suspected cases; 1 death), Lusaka (13; 0), Muchinga (3; 1), Northern (1; 0), Southern
(269; 2) and Western (19; 0). Cases presented with cutaneous eschars and had history of consumption of dead animals
suspected to have died of anthrax. The last outbreak of anthrax in Zambia occurred in 2011 with 511 cases and five deaths
(CFR: 1.0%) in humans and 85 cases among hippopotamuses reported from Chama district.
Zimbabwe: On 15 October 2023, Zimbabwe MoH reported 62 new suspected cases and no deaths of anthrax from Gokwe
South and North districts, Midlands province. Cases presented with eschars on the forearm after consumption of carcasses of
infected animals. Cumulatively since the beginning of 2023, 369 suspected cases and no deaths of anthrax have been reported
from one of 10 provinces in Zimbabwe. The last outbreak of anthrax in Zimbabwe was in 2021.
Anthrax is a zoonotic bacterial infection and can spread to humans through inhalation, handling and eating foods contaminated
with bacterial spores. Clinical presentations may vary from cutaneous, inhalation, gastrointestinal and injection types of anthrax.
The average CFR ranges from 20%-30% in cutaneous anthrax without antibiotic treatment and 25 - 75% for gastrointestinal
anthrax, 80% or higher in inhalation anthrax.
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
The MoH of the affected MS activated emergency operations centres (EOCs) and deployed rapid response teams to conduct
enhance surveillance, risk communication, environmental sanitation, safe burial of dead animals, risk communication and animal
vaccination

Assessment
Description:
On 26 October 2023, the Tunisia Ministry of Health (MoH) reported 10 new confirmed cases and one new death of West Nile
virus (WNV) (CFR: 10%) from five governorates: Gabes (2 confirmed cases; 0 deaths), Kef (1; 0), Monastir (1; 0), Sfax (1; 0) and
Tozeur (5; 1). Samples were tested using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction technique at Institut Pasteur, Tunis.
Cumulatively, since the beginning of 2023, 141 cases (10 confirmed; 131 suspected) and one death (CFR: 10%) of WNV have
been reported from five of 24 governorates in Tunisia.
WNV is a mosquito-borne zoonosis belonging to the genus Flavivirus in the Flaviviridae family. It is transmitted through bite of
infected mosquitoes. Birds are the primary hosts of WNV, thus the virus is maintained in the environment within a "bird—
mosquito—bird" transmission cycle. WNV can affect birds, humans and horses causing asymptomatic infection, mild febrile
illness, meningitis, encephalitis, or death. About 80% of cases in humans present with mild or no symptoms and about 20% of
cases develop fever, headache, vomiting, or a rash while 1% progress to severe forms of the disease with symptoms such as
meningitis with associated neck stiffness, confusion, or seizures. Since 2010, sporadic human meningoencephalitis cases have
been reported in different regions of Tunisia almost every year. The last outbreak of WNV in Tunisia occurred in 2022 with 171
cases and one death (CFR: 0.6%) reported from nine regions.
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
The MoH continues to conduct enhanced surveillance, risk communication and implement vector control measures in the
affected governorates.
