Update to Event:
As of 6 p.m. East African Time (EAT) 8 September 2023, a total of 12,319,039 COVID-19 cases and 258,502 deaths (CFR: 2.1%)
have been reported by the 55 AU MS. This represents 2% of all cases and 4% of all deaths reported globally. Fifty-three MS have
reported COVID-19 cases infected with the Alpha (50 MS), Beta (45), Delta (53), Gamma (5) and Omicron (51) variants of
concern (VOC). Additionally, 32 MS have reported the presence of the Omicron BA.2 subvariant, 17 Member States reported the
Omicron sub lineage (XBB.1.5), 12 MS reported the Omicron sub lineage (BF.7 or BA.5.2.1.7), and 2 Member States have
reported the Omicron sub lineage (XBB.1.16). Another subvariant of Omicron (B.1.1.529) called EG.5 has been detected and
reported in Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe and Oceania. As of 8 September 2023, seven Member States (Cape Verde, Central
African Republic, Egypt, Kenya, South Africa, Tunisia and Uganda) have reported the presence of this new variant of interest
(VOI). Following an initial risk assessment conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO), the public health risk associated
with EG.5 is currently rated as low on a global level, similar to the risk of XBB.1.16 and other VOls. Fifty-four (98%) MS are
currently providing COVID-19 vaccination to the general population.
Cumulatively, 1.1 billion doses have been administered on the continent. Of these doses administered, 570.5 million people have
been partially vaccinated, and 453.8 million have been fully vaccinated. Eritrea is the only AU MS yet to start COVID-19
vaccination roll out.
For Epi week 36 (28 August - 3 September 2023), 4,252* new COVID-19 cases were reported. The Eastern region accounted for
92% of the new COVID-19 cases reported this week, followed by the Northern (7%) and Western (1%). No cases were reported in
the Central and Southern region.
Last week, no new COVID-19 deaths were reported in Africa. More than eleven thousand new tests were conducted during the
past week. The weekly % test positivity increased from 8% to 36% compared to the previous week. Since February 2020, over
133 million COVID-19 tests have been conducted in Africa.
