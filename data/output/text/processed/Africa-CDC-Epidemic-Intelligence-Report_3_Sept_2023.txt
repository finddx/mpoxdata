Update to Event:
As of 6 p.m. East African Time (EAT) 1 September 2023, a total of 12,314,787 COVID-19 cases and 258,502 deaths (CFR: 2.1%)
have been reported by the 55 AU MS. This represents 2% of all cases and 4% of all deaths reported globally.
Fifty-three MS have reported COVID-19 cases infected with the Alpha (50 MS), Beta (45), Delta (53), Gamma (5) and Omicron
(51) variants of concern (VOC). Additionally, 32 MS have reported the presence of the Omicron BA.2 subvariant, 17 Member
States reported the Omicron sub lineage (XBB.1.5), 12 MS reported the Omicron sub lineage (BF.7 or BA.5.2.1.7), and 2 Member

detected and reported in Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe and Oceania. As of 24 August 2023, five Member States (Cape Verde,
Egypt, Kenya, South Africa and Uganda) have reported the presence of this new variant of interest (VOI). Following an initial risk
assessment conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO), the public health risk associated with EG.5 is currently rated as
low on a global level, similar to the risk of XBB.1.16 and other VOls.
Fifty-four (98%) MS are currently providing COVID-19 vaccination to the general population. Cumulatively, 1.1 billion doses have
been administered on the continent. Of these doses administered, 570.5 million people have been partially vaccinated, and 453.8
