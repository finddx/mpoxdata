Description:
On 24 July 2024, the Ethiopia Public Health Institute (EPHI) reported the occurrence of three successive landslides in the mountainous areas of
Gezei Gofa woreda, Gofa Zone, South Ethiopia region. The landslide was triggered by heavy rainfall that occurred on the night of 21 July 2024.
As of 24 July 2024, a total of 229 deaths, an unidentified number of displaced persons and 14,000 affected persons have been reported. The
reported deaths include an unidentified number of health extension workers, who were providing emergency support. The South Ethiopia
region has continued to experience heavy rainfall and heavy flooding in the past few months. The region has also reported outbreaks of
malaria, with 288,124 cases reported and measles, with 3,246 cases; six deaths reported since the beginning of this year. The occurrence of
heavy rains and the landslides pose a risk for occurrence of cholera and dengue, which have been reported in the neighbouring regions.
Landslides are a type of mass wasting, which denotes any down-slope movement of soil and rocks under the direct influence of gravity and are
often associated with a high number of mortalities, injuries and destruction of property and basic infrastructure. Landslides are often reported in
Ethiopia, often triggered by heavy rainfall and accompanied by flooding.
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
The Federal Government of Ethiopia in collaboration with partners is coordinating the response interventions. Africa CDC has deployed a team
of experts to support the response efforts.

Assessment
Description:
On 7 June 2024, the Western Cape Veterinary Provincial Department reported an outbreak of rabies among fur seals from Big Bay, Blouberg,
Cape Town. The report was made after confirmation of one Cape fur seal that died on 22 May 2024.
Rabies is a vaccine-preventable, Zoonotic, viral disease that infects the central nervous system. Rabies virus is transmitted through direct
contact with saliva or brain/nervous system tissue of an infected person or animal. Rabies is vaccine preventable; however, is 100% fatal in
humans once clinical symptoms appear. In up to 99% of cases, domestic dogs are responsible for rabies virus transmission to humans. Rabies
can affect both domestic and wild animals. Animal rabies is endemic throughout Africa. This year, South Africa has reported 3 confirmed cases
and three deaths of human rabies from two provinces: Eastern Cape (Eastern Cape (1; 1), KwaZulu Natal (1; 1) and Gauteng (1; 1).
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
The Western Cape Veterinary Services, the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and Environment, City of Cape Town Coastal Management and
other partners are working closely to establish the extent and timeline of the outbreak via further sampling and testing.
Africa CDC has engaged the National Institue for Communicable Diseases for areas of support.
