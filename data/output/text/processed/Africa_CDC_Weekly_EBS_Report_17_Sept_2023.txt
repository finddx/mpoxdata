Assessment
Description:
On 10 September 2023, Libya Ministry of Interior announced that the coastal city of Derna in eastern Libya and surrounding cities
namely Al-Marj, Benghazi and Sousse had been devastated by floods caused by torrential rains due to Storm Daniel. The city of
Derna was declared a disaster zone after two dams burst due to the rainstorm, forcing whole neighborhoods with their
residents into the sea. Storm Daniel was accompanied by flooding that destroyed infrastructure and buildings, leading to the
displacement of over 38,000 people. The destruction of these vital infrastructure, such as health and sanitation facilities, poses a
risk for the spread of communicable diseases in the affected areas. As of 13 September 2023, 6,872 deaths and 10,120 missing
people were reported by the Libyan authorities.
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
Libyan authorities in the east of the country declared a state of emergency, and closed schools and shops in the city. The Derna
city council has enacted a 7 p.m. - 8 a.m. curfew and carried out evacuations in the worst hit neighborhoods in the city. In
addition, the Libyan national army deployed rapid response teams (RRT) to manage the crisis.

Update to Event:
As of 6 p.m. East African Time (EAT) 18 September 2023, a total of 12,319,378 COVID-19 cases and 257,157 deaths (case
fatality ratio [CFR]: 2.1%) were reported by the 55 African Union (AU) Member States (MS). This represents 2% of all cases and
4% of all deaths reported globally. Fifty-three MS have reported COVID-19 cases infected with the Alpha (50 MS), Beta (45), Delta
(53), Gamma (5) and Omicron (51) variants of concern (VOC). Additionally, 32 MS have reported the presence of the Omicron
BA.2 subvariant, 17 Member States reported the Omicron sub lineage (XBB.1.5), 12 MS reported the Omicron sub lineage (BF.7
or BA.5.2.1.7), and 2 Member States have reported the Omicron sub lineage (XBB.1.16). Another subvariant of Omicron
(B.1.1.529) called EG.5 has been detected and reported in Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe and Oceania. As of 15 September
2023, nine Member States have reported the presence of this new variant of interest (VOI). Following an initial risk assessment
conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO), the public health risk associated with EG.5 is currently rated as low ona
global level, similar to the risk of XBB.1.16 and other VOls. Fifty-four (98%) MS are currently providing COVID-19 vaccination to
the general population. Last week, 338 new COVID-19 cases were reported in Africa. Last week no new COVID-19 deaths were
reported in Africa. More than one thousand tests were conducted during the past week. The weekly % test positivity decreased
from 5% to less than 1% compared to the previous week. Since February 2020, over 133 million COVID-19 tests have been
conducted in Africa.
Response by MS/partner/Africa CDC:
The emergency operations center (EOC) of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) has been
