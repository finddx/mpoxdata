Update to Event:
As of 6 p.m. East African Time (EAT) 5 October 2023, a total of 12,320,058 COVID-19 cases and 257,167 deaths (CFR: 2.1%) have
been reported by the 55 African Union Member States (MS). This represents 2% of all cases and 4% of all deaths reported globally.
Fifty-three MS have reported COVID-19 cases infected with the Alpha (50 MS), Beta (45), Delta (53), Gamma (5) and Omicron (51)
variants of concern (VOC). Additionally, 32 MS have reported the presence of the Omicron BA.2 sub-variant, 17 Member States
reported the Omicron sub lineage (XBB.1.5), 12 MS reported the Omicron sub lineage (BF.7 or BA.5.2.1.7), and 2 Member States
have reported the Omicron sub lineage (XBB.1.16). Another sub-variant of Omicron (B.1.1.529) called EG.5 has been detected and
reported in Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe and Oceania. As of 5 October 2023, nine Member States: Cape Verde, Central African
Republic, Egypt, Kenya, Mauritius, Morocco, South Africa, Tunisia and Uganda have reported the presence of this new variant of
interest (VOI). Following an initial risk assessment conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO), the public health risk
associated with EG.5 is currently rated as low on a global level, similar to the risk of XBB.1.16 and other VOls. Fifty-four (98%) MS
are currently providing COVID-19 vaccination to the general population.Cumulatively, 1.1 billion doses have been administered on the
continent. Of these doses administered, 570.6 million people have been partially vaccinated, and 446.9 million have been fully
vaccinated. Eritrea is the only AU MS yet to start COVID-19 vaccination roll out.
For Epi week 39 (25 September - 1 October), 170 new COVID-19 cases were reported from the Western region. No cases were
reported in the Central, Eastern, Northern and Southern regions. Last week, no new COVID-19 deaths were reported in Africa. More
