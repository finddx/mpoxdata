Assessment

Description:
On 21 April 2023, the Senegal MoH reported an outbreak of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in Fadia city, Guediawaye
district, Dakar region. The index case was a 35-year-old-male butcher from Fadia city. On 10 April 2023, he presented at Dalal Jamm
hospital with flu-like symptoms. On 21 April 2023, blood samples were collected and CCHF was confirmed at Institut Pasteur, Dakar
by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). He died on 22 April 2023 after developing
hemorrhagic symptoms and was given a safe and dignified burial on 24 April 2023. So far, no other confirmed case has been
reported, however, 19 suspected cases have been identified from the contact list and are being investigated.
CCHF is a zoonotic viral hemorrhagic fever that can spread through bites of infected ticks. It can also be transmitted from animals to
humans through contact with blood, body fluids, or tissues of infected animals, mainly livestock such as cattle, sheep, goats,
buffalo and camels. Although livestock can be infected with the virus, most do not manifest clinical symptoms. There is currently no
approved safe and effective vaccine for human use, and treatment for CCHF is primarily supportive. The last outbreak of CCHF in
Senegal was in November 2022 with a single case and no death reported from Dakar.

Response:
The MoH has activated the emergency operation centre and has also deployed a multi-sectoral, multi-disciplinary team to Dakar to
support with response activities. A total of 87 contacts were identified from two districts namely Guediawaye (83 contacts) and Dakar
ciity centre (4). All contacts are being monitored and three of the 87 contacts have completed their monitoring cycle. Additionally, the
veterinary services are monitoring livestock in the affected area.

Assessment

Description:
On 2 May 2023, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) of South Africa reported two confirmed cases and no
deaths of of diphtheria from KwaZulu Natal (1 confirmed case) and Western Cape provinces (1).
Diphtheria is a bacterial infection caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, a toxin-producing bacteria. Diphtheria manifests in two
forms: respiratory (most commonly seen) and cutaneous. Person-to-person transmission is usually through respiratory droplets
(respiratory form) and contact with infected sores and ulcers on the skin (cutaneous form). Symptoms for the respiratory form include
weakness, sore throat, fever, swollen lymph nodes, difficulty breathing, and death in more severe cases. The toxin produced by the
bacteria destroys healthy respiratory tissues forming a thick gray coating on the throat, tonsils and nose making it difficult to breathe
and swallow. The toxin can also affect the heart, nervous system, and kidneys if the infection is systemic. The overall case fatality rate
for the respiratory form of diphtheria is between 5 to 10%, with higher death rates (up to 20%) among persons less than five or older
than 40 years old. Laboratory diagnosis is made via bacterial culture, Elek test or PCR. Treatment includes anti-toxins and antibiotic
therapy. Vaccines are available to protect against infection and typically given in four doses as part of routine immunization programs.
In South Africa, the last outbreak of diphtheria occurred in 2022, in which three confirmed cases with no deaths were reported from
Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces.

Response:
Samples collected from all contacts tested negative for diphtheria. Currently there is no diphtheria anti-toxin available in the
country. The Western Cape provincial department of health is working with the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority to
get more stock into the country.

[CFR]: 2.1%) were reported by the 55 African Union (AU) Member States (MS). This represents 2% of all cases and 4% of all deaths
reported globally. Forty-four (80%) AU MS are reporting case fatality rates (CFR) higher than the global CFR. Fifty three MS have
reported COVID-19 cases infected with the Alpha (50 MS), Beta (45), Delta (53), Gamma (5) and Omicron (51) variants of concern
(VOC). Additionally, 32 MS have reported the presence of the Omicron BA.2 sub-variant, 12 Member States reported the Omicron
sublineage (BF.7 or BA.5.2.1.7), ten MS reported the Omicron sublineage (XBB.1.5), and 2 Member States are now reporting the
Omicron sublineage (XBB.1.16).
Fifty-four (98%) MS are currently providing COVID-19 vaccination to the general population. Cumulatively, 1.1 billion doses have
been administered on the continent. Of these doses administered, 546.5 million people have been partially vaccinated, and 431.7
million have been fully vaccinated. Eritrea is the only AU MS yet to start COVID-19 vaccination roll out.
For Epi week 17 (24 April - 3 May 2023), 1,040 new COVID-19 cases were reported, which is a 66% decrease in the number of new
cases reported compared to the previous week (16). The Northern region accounted for 45% of the new COVID-19 cases reported
this week, followed by the Central (18%), Eastern (18%), Western (16%) and Southern (3%) regions. Two AU Member States, Cabo
Verde (29) and Comoros (9) had the highest number of new daily COVID-19 cases per million population among all MS.
Last week, 11 new COVID-19 deaths were reported in Africa, which is 54% decrease in new deaths reported compared to the
previous week. The Northern region accounted for 80% of the new COVID-19 deaths reported this week, followed by the Western
(20%). No deaths were reported in the Central, Eastern, Southern regions this week.
More than 27 thousand tests were conducted during the past week, reflecting a 7% increase in the number of tests compared to the
previous week. The weekly % test positivity decreased from 13% to 4% compared to the previous week. Since February 2020, over
126.4 million COVID-19 tests have been conducted in Africa.
Response:
The emergency operations center (EOC) of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) has been activated
for COVID-19 since 27 January 2020. For more information on Africa CDC’s response efforts please refer to Africa CDC’s website,
